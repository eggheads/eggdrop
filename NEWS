A lot of things have changed in this version so at a minimum read the
UPDATES1.5 text file. UPDATES shows whats been added and fixed
along the way.


CAUTION:

     1. Before you start the bot for the first time BACKUP your
     userfile if this is an upgrade from a previous version.

     2. DON'T USE YOUR OLD CONFIG FILE.. MAKE A NEW ONE.........

Changes made to Eggdrop 1.5.xx from Eggdrop1.4.xx

!CHANNELS

     Support for IRCNET !channels was added to eggdrop. Also this
     might be still a bit buggy, it should work basically. We
     appreciate bug reports!

+/-NODESYNCH

     This new channel setting replaces the old 'allow-desync' setting
     from global to channel functionality. This setting is usefull if
     you use some kind of chanserv or if you don't care about your
     channel being desynch.

ASYNCHRONOUS DNS MODULE

     Eggdrop 1.5 is shipped with a new module, the dns module. It
     replaces those old dns-lookups performed by eggdrop which could
     halt the whole bot during a time-out. We also added a new tcl
     command 'dnslookup', so scripts can look up IP's and hostname now
     asynchronously, too.

COMPRESS MODULE

     A new module called compress was introduced to eggdrop now. It
     provides gzip support to eggdrop (via tcl commands) and enables 
     compressed userfile transfer.

DCC COMMANDS

     * ".nick" was renamed to ".handle". ".nick" will still be kept
       up to version 1.8.
     * ".chnick" was renamed to ".chhandle". ".chnick" will still be kept
       up to version 1.8.
     * .binds supports now wildcards

DOCUMENTATION

     A lot has happend to the documentation, nearly every file was changed
     or modified, so keep a look at them. Also we discovered html now and
     full html documentation is avilable now in doc/html.
     Additionally all possible settings in eggdrop are documented in
     doc/settings

EGGDROP.CONF.DIST

     eggdrop.conf.dist was replaced with three files, eggdrop.simple.conf, 
     eggdrop.advanced.conf and eggdrop.complete.conf. This allows users to
     choose how detailed they want to configure their bot. eggdrop.simple.conf
     just contains the simplest configuration options, where
     eggdrop.advanced.conf goes more into details and eggdrop.complete.conf
     contains all possible settings.

LOGFILES

     Eggdrop uses strftime now to support different log files suffixes. The
     new setting is 'logfile-suffix'

NICK LENGTH

     To support longer nicknames as some irc servers do (dalnet I
     think) a settings was added for this one (nick-len).

PENALTY CALCULATION

     Eggdrop calculates penalty points on IRCNET now, so it won't
     flood itself off anymore. This feature also works on Efnet and
     Undernet. Should work on other networks, too

SHARE MODULE

     Share module got a new setting now (override-bots) which allows
     hub bots to override the leafs bot setting (botadress, telnet
     port and password). Please note, that this won't work with a 1.4
     or even 1.3 bot.

TCL COMMANDS

     * chnick was renamed to chhandle. The use of chnick is deprecated.
       chnick will is still accessible if you load compat.tcl
     * All three commands to add stuff to the queus (puthelp, putserv
       and putquick) support the '-next' parameter now which pushes
       data to the front of the queues.
     * A command to calculate md5 checksums was added (md5).
     * To support the new asynch dns module, the command 'dnslookup'
       was added.
     * Four new commands regarding exempts/invites were added
       stickexempt/unstickexempt, stickinvite/unstickinvite
     * New command wasop was added to check if a user had op before a
       mode change.
     * Three new tcl commands came with the compress module
       compressfile/uncompressfile and iscompressed
     * A new command to check whether the bot's nick is juped was
       added (isjuped)
     * binds NOTC and PART were upgraded so msg in them can be kept now.
     * fileresend command was added to support mIRC's dcc resume feature

     For more information about this changed or added tcl commands see
     doc/tcl-commands.doc

TRAFFIC ACCOUNTING

     Eggdrop counts the whole traffic which it generates and receives
     through irc,botnet and dcc now. You can access these statistica
     via the dcc command '.traffic'. Please note, that the counter
     gets reset every time a restart is done.

TRANSFER / FILESYS MODULE

     The filesys and transfer modules have changed completely. Both
     can handle now unlimited filename lengths and description sizes.
     Incomplete downloads from the bot can be resumed now.
     The db format of the filesys module was also changed to remove
     the limits imposed by the old format. There's nothing special for
     you to do as the old db is automatically converted to the new
     format when you first access it. You won't be able to downgrade
     to older versions after this though, so maybe you'll want to make
     a backup first.
