  What's new? First, read the following documents:

    INSTALL
    README
    doc/TLS
    doc/IPV6
    doc/Changes1.8
    doc/tcl-commands.doc

  All of these documents combined will fill you in on the latest changes to
  Eggdrop in version 1.8.x. All files, with the exception of Changes1.8, are
  also available in html format in doc/html/.

  A lot of things have changed in this version, so at a minimum, read the
  Changes1.8 text file. Changes shows what's been added and fixed along the
  way.

  If you are upgrading from a pre-1.6 version of Eggdrop:

    1. Before you start the bot for the first time, BACKUP your userfile.

    2. DON'T USE YOUR OLD CONFIG FILE. MAKE A NEW ONE!

  SSL

    Full SSL support has been added for all kinds of connections, including
    certificate verification and authorization. See doc/TLS.
