Eggdrop v1.9.0:

  General changes:
    - Fixed an issue where adding a server without a port could create a
      condition where Eggdrop would crash on startup
    - Fixed a bad merge in 1.9.0 that resulted in away status not being
      properly tracked by Eggdrop
    - Fixed/clarified some of the terrible error messages we've all come to
      know and love for socket connections

  Botnet changes:
    - None

  Tcl API changes:
    - None

  Module changes:
    - Fixed a bug in the CTCP module that resulted in an IP in the socket table
      being incorrectly overwritten, causing trouble with future CTCP chat
      requests. This was also prevents some Eggdrop's from incorrectly throwing
      a Tcl error during a rehash
    - Fixed an error message that incorrectly appeared after a restart when
      using the PBKDF2 module

  Eggdrop config file changes:
    - None
