  In general, always make a BACKUP of your config and user/chanfile.

     _________________________________________________________________

Eggdrop v1.9.3:

 General changes:
    - Added the ability to track services account names for users in a channel
      and those added to an Eggdrop. To work properly, this feature requires a
      server that supports WHOX requests and can negotiate the extended-join
      and account-notify capabilities
    - Added the +account and -account partyline commands to add or remove a
      services account name to a handle
    - Updated .channel output to display services account names associated with
      channel users
    - Added the ability to create a timer with a custom name instead of the
      default "timerXX" format
    - Fixed a compile error if TLS libraraies weren't detected on the host OS
    - Fixed a compile error for pthreads found mainly on BSD systems
    - Fixed a bug with threaded DNS queries where threads were not terminated
      properly, potentially resulting in an out-of-memory error
    - Fixed an issue where PLAIN SASL authentication incorrectly errored unless
      (unneeded) TLS libraries were installed
    - Updated information obtained via extended-join to all channels the user is
      on, not just the channel they joined
    - Force ident requests to originate from the specified vhost/listen IP
    - Reorganized the documentation structure

 Botnet changes:
    - None

 Tcl API changes:
    - Updated the 'finduser' command to accept the -account flag. Using this
      flag will search the userfile and return the handle that contains the
      provided account name
    - Updated the getuser and setuser commands to accept the "ACCOUNT" entry
    - Added the 'accounttracking' variable, which returns a '1' if all three
      requirements (WHOX, extended-join, and account-notify) are available and
      active for the current server connection
    - Added an optional timer name field to the timer and utimer commands
    - Updated docs to reflect a value of '0' for the server-online value when
      Eggdrop is disconnected

 Module changes:
    - None

 Eggdrop config changes:
    - None

     _________________________________________________________________

Eggdrop v1.9.2:

 General changes:
    - Added CAP 302 support, and generally enhance CAP support
    - Enabled threaded core DNS requests as the default method for DNS lookups;
      this can be disabled with ./configure --disable-tdns
    - Added support for the MONITOR CAP capability, allowing tracking of online
      and offline nicknames
    - Added support for the 005 BOT flag, allowing tracking of users that
      declare themselves as bots to the IRC server
    - Added SSL status to the .bottree command, denoted with a '=' symbol
    - Fixed allowing Eggdrop to process message-tags even if the message-tags
      capability is not explicitly requested
    - Alt-nick is now used before a randomly generated nickname if the requested
      nickname is rejected as invalid by the server. This feature is now
      divorced of any previous dependence on the keep-nick setting, with the
      reasoning that getting the Eggdrop onto the server with a random nick is
      more important than keeping a nickname and not ever joining, particularly
      from a troubleshooting standpoint
    - RAWT binds returning a '1' now block similar RAW binds from triggering
      by the same activity (but RAW binds cannot block a RAWT bind- use a RAWT!)
    - Fixed mistakenly requiring a flag for the 'listen script' command
    - Fixed an issue with Eggdrop not properly updating the account-tracking
      status

  Botnet changes:
    - None

  Tcl API changes:
    - Added the 'monitor' command, which allows interaction with the CAP
      MONITOR capability
    - Added the 'isircbot' command, which returns if a user has registered as a
      bot with the IRC server
    - Added the 'server list' command, which lists servers added to Eggdrop
    - Added the USERNOTICE bind to the Twitch module
    - Added a 'values' argument to the 'cap' command, outputting the display of
      CAP 302 values, if any, associated with each capability

  Module changes:
    - Fixed bug in PBKDF2 that caused PBKDF2-only environments to not store
      hashes properly, resulting in 'bad password' errors after relinking
    - Deprecated the DNS module (functionality has been moved core Eggdrop
      code). Eggdrop now natively handles asynchronous DNS (which was the
      purpose of the DNS module), so the DNS module is no longer needed
    - Fixed a bug with the Twitch module where it would crash on .rehash and
      .restart

  Eggdrop config file changes:
    - Added the 'extended-join' setting, to enable the extended-join CAP
      capability
    - Moved DNS-related settings out of the modules section and into the core
      config area
    - No longer load the (now-deprecated) DNS module by default

     _________________________________________________________________

Eggdrop v1.9.1:

  General changes:
    - Fixed an issue where an IP address was incorrectly overwritten after a
      CTCP chat was received
    - Fixed an issue where Eggdrop would occasionally crash if no port was
      provided when the server was added
    - Error, instead of silently change, when adding a bot with invalid ascii
      characters in the handle (.+bot)
    - Removed an incorrect error message after restarting the bot with the
      PBKDF2 module loaded
    - Further improved error reporting for socket connections

  Botnet changes:
    - None

  Tcl API changes:
    - Fixed the isaway command to properly track AWAY server messages

  Module changes:
    - None

  Eggdrop config file changes:
    - Added Libera Chat to the accepted server types

     _________________________________________________________________

Eggdrop v1.9.0:

  General changes:
    - Added CAP support, allowing Eggdrop to extend IRC server capabilities
    - Added support for SASL authentication
    - Added a BETA threaded DNS capability, enabled with the --enable-tdns
      configure flag. This allows asynchronus DNS requests similar to the what
      the current DNS module offers, but using host system capability instead
      of rewriting it from scratch. Using this means you no longer have to use
      the DNS module.
    - Eggdrop can listen on multiple IPs (and ports) now by using multiple
      instances of the 'listen' command
    - Added Twitch support
    - Added support for users that change hosts mid-session, usually associated
      with authenticating with services (396 raw code and CHGHOST capability).
    - Added support for the users that change their realname value mis-session
      (SETNAME capability)
    - Added the ability for Eggdrop to internally track the away status of an
      individual, with some limitations.
    - Added the 'make sslsilent' option that creates an SSL certificate keypair
      non-interactively, to assist in scripted/automated installs
    - Differentiate between scripted and server WHOX calls, preventing mangling
      of channel userlists
    - The -n flag is no longer required to run Eggdrop in terminal mode; just
      -t or -c are fine by themselves
    - Added some checks to flags added via .chattr and .botattr to clearly
      identify what happens when you add flags that can't co-exist together

  Botnet changes:
    - Removed automatic upgrade to TLS-protected botnet links with STARTTLS.
      Based on user feedback, protecting a botnet link is now at the discretion
      of the user. Prefixing a port with a '+' will require a TLS connection,
      otherwise the connection will be in plaintext. A port not prefixed with a
      + can still be upgraded with STARTTLS, allowing 1.8 bots and scripts to
      initiate a secure connection, but 1.9.0 bots will not attempt the upgrade.
    - Added granular userfile sharing flags (bcejnu). Adding these flags can limit
      userfile sharing to a combination of bans, invites, exempts, channels,
      users, and ignores (or still the s flag for all these).
    - No longer try port+1,2,3 when connecting to a botnet port doesn't work
      the first time

  Tcl API changes:
    - Added the RAWT bind, which will (eventually) phase out the RAW bind.
      Implementing the IRCv3 message-tags capability requires a new way to
      handle basic IRC messages, and RAWT was added in a way so that a) RAW
      binds in old scripts still work and b) the RAWT bind can handle messages
      that either do or do not have message-tags attached
    - Added the INVT bind, allowing Eggdrop to react to a standard invitation,
      or the new IRCv3 invite-notify capability
    - Added the AWY3 bind, allowing Eggdrop to react to the new IRCv3
      away-notify capability.
    - Added the refreshchan command, which refreshes without removing existing
      channel status information tracked by Eggdrop for users on a channel.
    - Added the isaway command, which returns if a user is listed by the server
      as away or not, if using the IRCv3 away-notify capability. If away-notify
      is not enabled, this command can still be used effectively in conjunction
      with 'refreshchan w', described above.
    - Added the hand2nicks command, an alternative to the hand2nick command.
      hand2nicks returns ALL nicks matching a handle, not just the first one.
    - Added the socklist command, an update to the dcclist command. Returns
      similar info as a Tcl dict, and adds the IP to the information.
    - Use the system's strftime formatting instead of Eggdrop-provided
      GNU version/extensions. This could cause formatting differences
      or errors between systems. To ensure fully portable code, developers
      should only rely on POSIX-compliant formatting specifiers.
    - The dcclist command now returns port information and whether or not TLS
      is in use for that port. This change could affect field-based parsers
      depending on this command
    - Added the addserver and delserver command, to *gasp* add and delete a
      server from Eggdrop's server list
    - Modified the listen command to accept an optional IP argument. This
      allows Eggdrop to listen on multiple addresses by using multiple listen
      commands in the config file or Tcl script. If no IP is specified, 0.0.0.0
      is used as default. As a result of this change, the listen-addr command
      is no longer needed and removed from the config file
    - Added an optional -channel flag to the end of the is* commands (isban,
      isexempt, etc). This flag prevents the is* command from checking the
      global list and returning a '1' when there is no channel-specific case
    - Added several Tcl commands and binds to enable better interaction with
      the Twitch gaming service. Because these commands only work with a Twitch
      server, they are not included in tcl-commands.doc but rather
      twitch-tcl-commands.doc, located in the doc/ directory.
    - Limited the expiration for new bans, ignores and exempts to 2000 days.

  Module changes:
    - Added the PBKDF2 module, which allows Eggdrop to hash passwords using the
      PBKDF2 algorithm. This module is a stepping stone to future, more
      adaptable hashing and encryption implementation. IMPORTANT: PLEASE read
      doc/PBKDF2 for more information on how to properly use it, you could
      accidentally render old passwords useless!
    - Added the twitch module, which allows Eggdrop to connect to the Twitch
      gaming service. As Twitch offers only a limited subset of standard IRC
      functionality, be prepared for some commands or scripts to work
      differently than on a normal IRC server. Please read doc/TWITCH for more
      information.
    - Added the ident module, which can automatically interact with a running
      oidentd service or allow Eggdrop to serve as its own ident server to
      respond to ident requests during the server connection process.

  Eggdrop config file changes:
    - Added additional net-types for freenode, Quakenet, and Rizon (net-type)
    - Added ability to choose specific SSL/TLS protocols to use (ssl-protocols)
    - Added ability to allow bots to remain linked if userfile sharing fails
      (sharefail-unlink)
    - Changed the method Eggdrop uses to add servers from a {} list to the new
      addserver command
    - Removed the listen-addr command. See above; the listen command now
      accepts an optional IP argument in lieu of using listen-addr
    - Added the show-uname setting, which allows you to disable the display of
      uname info for the host system in things like .status
