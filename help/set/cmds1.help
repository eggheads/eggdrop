   This banner will be displayed on telnet connections. Look at
   doc/TEXT-SUBSTITUTIONS for options.

   If you have a NAT firewall (you box has an IP in one of the
   following ranges: 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255,
   172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255, 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 and your
   firewall transparently changes your address to a unique address
   for your box) or you have IP masquerading between you and the
   rest of the world, and /dcc chat, /ctcp chat or userfile sharing
   aren't working, enter your outside IP here. Do not enter anything
   for my-ip or my-hostname if you use this setting.
%{help=set dcc-sanitycheck}%{+n}
###  %bset dcc-sanitycheck%b <0/1>
   This setting will make the bot ignore DCC chat requests which
   appear to have bogus information on the grounds that the user may
   have been trying to make the bot connect to somewhere that will
   get it into trouble, or that the user has a broken client (like
   mIRC tends to do), in which case the connect wouldn't work anyway.
   It's suggested that you turn this on.
%{help=set network}%{+n}
###  %bset network%b <net-name>
   This setting is used only for info to share with others on your
   botnet. Set this to the IRC network your bot is connected to.
%{help=set whois-fields}%{+n}
###  %bset whois-fields%b <field-list>
   Enter all user-defined fields that should be displayed in a

   userinfo1.0.tcl script which provides commands for changing all
   of these.
%{help=set username}%{+n}
###  %bset username%b <username>
   This setting defines the username the bot uses on IRC. This setting
   has no effect if an ident daemon is running on your bot's machine.
%{help=set version}%{+n}
###  %bset version%b

   text version, second item is a numerical version, and any following
   items are the names of patches that have been added.
%{help=set firewall}%{+n}
###  %bset firewall%b <host:port>
   Set this to your socks host if your Eggdrop sits behind a
   firewall. If you use a Sun "telnet passthru" firewall, prefix
   the host with a '!'.
%{help=set telnet-flood}%{+n}
###  %bset telnet-flood%b <times:seconds>
   Define here how many telnet connection attempts in how many
   seconds from the same host constitute a flood. The correct
   format is Attempts:Seconds.
%{help=set paranoid-telnet-flood}%{+n}
###  %bset paranoid-telnet-flood%b <0/1>

   including such things as note notifying or userfile saving, are
   affected by this.
%{help=set switch-logfiles-at}%{+n}
###  %bset switch-logfiles-at%b <military-time>
   You can specify when Eggdrop should switch logfiles and start
   fresh. You must use military time for this setting. 300 is the
   default, and describes 03:00 (AM).

###  %bset connect-timeout%b <seconds>
   This settings defines a time in seconds that the bot should
   wait before a dcc chat, telnet, or relay connection times out.
%{help=set resolve-timeout}%{+n}
###  %bset resolve-timeout%b <seconds>

###  %bset dupwait-timeout%b <seconds>
   If your Eggdrop rejects bots that actually have already
   disconnected from another hub, but the disconnect information has
   not yet spread over the botnet due to lag, use this setting. The
   bot will wait dupwait-timeout seconds before it checks again and
   then finally reject the bot.
%{help=set reserved-portrange}%{+n}
###  %bset reserved-portrange%b <lowport>:<highport>

   All logfiles will get suffix
   ".[2 digit day][3 letter month][4 digit year]". Note that your
   quota/hard-disk might be filled by this, so check your logfiles
   often and download them.
%{help=set open-telnets}%{+n}
###  %bset open-telnets%b <0/1>
   If you want people allow to telnet in and type 'NEW' to become a
   new user, set this to 1. This is similar to the 'hello' msg
   command. The protect-telnet setting must be set to 0 to use this.
%{help=set stealth-telnets}%{+n}
###  %bset stealth-telnets%b <0/1>
   If you don't want Eggdrop to identify itself as an eggdrop on a
   telnet connection, set this setting to 1. Eggdrop will display
   'Nickname' instead.

###  %bset use-telnet-banner%b <0/1>
   If you want Eggdrop to display a banner when telneting in, set
   this setting to 1. The telnet banner is set by 'set telnet-banner'.
%{help=set handlen}%{+n}
###  %bset handlen%b
   This is the max length handles may be on the bot.
%{help=set console}%{+n}
###  %bset console%b <console-flags>
   This is the default console mode. It uses the same event flags
   as the log files do. The console channel is automatically set to
   your "primary" channel, which is set in the modules section of
   the config file. Masters can change their console channel and modes
   with the '.console' command.
%{help=set default-flags}%{+n}
###  %bset default-flags%b <flags>
   Enter the flags that all new users should get by default. See
   '.help whois' on the partyline for a list of flags and their
   descriptions.
%{help=set log-time}%{+n}
###  %bset log-time%b <0/1>
   Use this feature to timestamp entries in the log file.
%{help=set max-logsize}%{+n}
###  %bset max-logsize%b <filesize>
   This is the maximum size of your logfiles. Set it to 0 to disable.
   This value is in kilobytes, so '550' would mean cycle logs when it
   reaches the size of 550 kilobytes. Note that this only works if you
   have keep-all-logs 0 (OFF).
%{help=set quick-logs}%{+n}
###  %bset quick-logs%b <0/1>
   This could be good if you have had problem with the logfile
   filling your quota/hard disk or if you log +p and publish it to
   the web and need more up-to-date info. Note that this setting
   might increase the CPU usage of your bot (on the other hand it will
   decrease your mem usage).
%{help=set logfile-suffix}%{+n}
###  %bset logfile-suffix%b <suffix>
   If keep-all-logs is 1, this setting will define the suffix of the
   logfiles. The default will result in a suffix like "04May2000".
   "%Y%m%d" will produce the often used yyyymmdd format. Read the
   strftime manpages for more options. NOTE: On systems which don't
   support strftime, the default format will be used _always_.
%{help=set quiet-save}%{+n}
###  %bset quiet-save%b <0/1>
   "Writing user file..." and "Writing channel file..." messages
   won't be logged anymore if this option is enabled.
%{help=set sort-users}%{+n}
###  %bset sort-users%b <0/1>
   If you want your userfile to be sorted upon saving, enable this
   setting. This causes the bot to use bit more CPU when saving the
   usefile.
%{help=set die-on-sighup}%{+n}
###  %bset die-on-sighup%b <0/1>
   Enable this setting if you want your Eggdrop to die upon receiving
   a SIGHUP kill signal. Otherwise, the Eggdrop will just save its
   userfile and rehash.
%{help=set die-on-sigterm}%{+n}
###  %bset die-on-sigterm%b <0/1>
   Enable this setting if you want your Eggdrop to die upon receiving
   a SIGTERM kill signal. Otherwise, the Eggdrop will just save its
   userfile and rehash.
%{help=set remote-boots}%{+n}
###  %bset remote-boots%b <0/1>
   This setting defines whether or not people can boot users on the
   Eggdrop from other bots in your botnet. Valid settings are:
     0 - allow *no* outside boots
     1 - allow boots from sharebots
     2 - allow any boots
%{help=set max-dcc}%{+n}
###  %bset max-dcc%b <max dcc connections>
   Set here the maximum number of dcc connections you will allow.
   You can increase this later, but never decrease it.
%{help=set max-logs}%{+n}
###  %bset max-logs%b <max number of logs>
   This is the maximum number of logfiles allowed. This setting
   can be increased; however, don't decrease it.
%{help=set protect-telnet}%{+n}
###  %bset protect-telnet%b <0/1>
   This setting will drop telnet connections not matching a known
   host. It greatly improves protection from IRCops, but makes it
   impossible to add hosts on limbo (NOIRC) bots or have NEW as a
   valid login.
%{help=set ident-timeout}%{+n}
###  %bset ident-timeout%b <timeout>
   This settings defines a time in seconds that the bot should wait
   before a dcc chat, telnet, or relay connection times out.
%{help=set share-unlinks}%{+n}
###  %bset share-unlinks%b 0/1
   This setting prohibits remote bots from telling your Eggdrop to
   unlink from share bots.
%{help=set allow-dk-cmds}%{+n}
###  %bset allow-dk-cmds%b <0/1>
   Enable this setting if you want +d & +k users to use commands
   bound as -|-.
%{help=set userfile-perm}%{+n}
###  %bset userfile-perm%b <octal value>
   This specifies what permissions the user, channel, and notes
   files should be set to. The octal values are the same as for
   the chmod system command.
