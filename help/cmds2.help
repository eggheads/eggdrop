%{help=fixcodes}%{-}
###  %bfixcodes%b
   This is for use in situations where the bot gets mixed up about the type
   of connection you have with it. For example, you /CTCP CHAT the bot and
   it thinks you are connecting via telnet, and you see text displayed as
   "Local time is now [1m17:17[0m" for example instead of "Local time is
   now 17:17". Use this to turn telnet codes on or off/change the display
   mode.
%{help=ignores}%{+m}
###  %bignores%b [wildcard]
   Shows a list of hostmasks from which the bot is currently ignoring msgs,
   notices, etc. There are two types of ignores: permanent and temporary.
   Permanent ignores never automatically expire. You must use %b'.-ignore'%b
   to remove them.

   Here is a sample permanent ignore:
      [  1] *!*@217.156.44.184 (perm)
            Wcc: go away
            Started 523 days ago

   The number (1) can be used to reference the ignore if you wish to remove it
   (see %b'.help -ignore'%b). Next is the actual hostmask being ignored. The
   "(perm)" means that the ignore is "permanent": that is, it doesn't
   automatically expire. The second line of the ignore entry is the comment
   ("go away"), and who set the ban (Wcc). The last line shows when the ignore
   was added.

   Here is a sample temporary ignore:
      [ 10] blah!blah@blah.cc (expires in 1 day)
            Wcc: requested
            Started 18:02

   Here, you see the "perm" in the parentheses next to the hostmask is instead
   an expire time. This means that the ignore will expire automatically in one
   day.

   If you use %b'.ignores <wildcard>'%b, it will list all the ignores
   that match against your wildcard.

%{help=link}%{+t}
###  %blink%b [via-bot] <bot-to-link>
   Attempts to link a bot to the botnet. The local bot must have a bot record
   for the remote bot in order for it to be linked (see %b'.help +bot'%b). If
   you do not set a password on both bots, one will be automatically negotiated
   the first time they link. If you specify a "via-bot", a request will be sent
   to that bot to link to "bot-to-link".

See also: unlink, +bot, -bot
%{help=loadmod}%{+n}
###  %bloadmod%b <module>
   Loads the specified module.

See also: modules, module, unloadmod
%{help=match}%{+o|o}
###  %bmatch%b <attr> [channel] [[start] limit]
   This displays all user records with the attributes requested.

   "attr" is of the form:  <+/-><global>[&/|<channel>[&/|<bot>]]

   Specifying "&" as the separator will cause AND style matching.

   For example:
      .match +p&o

   This will match all users with both the "p" global flag and the "o" channel
   flag on your current console channel.

   Specifying "|" as the separator will cause OR style matching.

   For example:
     .match +p|o

   This will match all users with either the "p" global flag or the "o" channel
   flag on your current console channel. If you specify a channel, it will be
   used instead of the current console channel.

   For example:
     .match +p|o #eggdrop

   This will match all users with either the "p" global flag or the "o" channel
   flag on the channel #eggdrop. You can also match bot flags.

   For example:
     .match +o|o|h

   This will match all bots with either the "o" global flag, the "o" channel
   flag on the current console channel, or the "h" botflag. You can also limit
   the number of total results returned by specifying a limit at the end of the
   command. A starting point can also be specified.

   For example:
     .match +p&o #eggdrop 16 25

   This would show results 16 through 25 matching any users with the "p" global
   flag or the "o" channel flag on #eggdrop.

###  %bmatch%b <wildcard-string> [[start] limit]
   This displays all user records where the user's handle or any of the user's
   hostmasks match the specified wildcard string. You can also limit the number
   of total results returned by specifying a limit at the end of the command. A
   starting point can also be specified.

   For example:
     .match *.edu 16 25

   This would show results 16 through 25 matching any users with a hostmask
   that ends with ".edu".
%{help=me}%{-}
###  %bme%b <text>
   Performs an action on the party line. This appears as "* Wcc is leaving",
   etc.
%{help=module}%{+n}
###  %bmodule%b [modulename]
   Reports the names of currently loaded modules, including dependencies and a
   status report. If you specify a module name, only information on that module
   will be displayed.

See also: modules, loadmod, unloadmod
%{help=modules}%{+n}
###  %bmodules%b [botname]
   Displays a list of currently loaded modules. If a botname is specified, the
   modules currently loaded on that bot will be displayed instead.

See also: module, loadmod, unloadmod
%{help=motd}%{-}
###  %bmotd%b [botname]
   This redisplays the partyline Message Of The Day, which was shown when you
   first joined the partyline. If the name of a remote bot is specified, that
   bot's motd will be displayed instead.
%{help=newpass}%{-}
###  %bnewpass%b <password>
   Changes your password on the bot. This is similar to the '/msg <bot> pass'
   command, except you don't need to specify your old password.
%{+t}

See also: chpass
%{help=handle}%{-}
###  %bhandle%b <new-handle>
   Changes your handle on the bot. This is the handle (nickname) that the
   bot will know you as from this point forward. It is used to log into the
   bot, and for the /msg IDENT command, etc.

See also: newpass%{+t}, chhand, chpass
%{help=note}%{-}
###  %bnote%b <nickname[@bot]> <message>
   Sends a private note to a user on the partyline. If that user is currently
   logged in and not marked as away, the message will be received immediately.
   Otherwise, it will be stored and displayed the next time that user joins the
   partyline. To send a note to someone on a different bot, add "nick@bot" to
   the nickname.

See also: whom, notes
%{help=page}%{-}
###  %bpage%b <number/off>
   This allows you to slow down the number of lines the bot sends you at once
   via the partyline. When enabled, any commands that send greater than the
   specified number of lines will stop when that number is reached and wait for
   you to type another command (or press enter) to continue. If you have too
   many pending lines, you may be booted off the bot.
%{help=quit}%{-}
###  %bquit%b [comment]
   This disconnects you from the partyline. If you specify a comment, it will
   be displayed to other partyline users as you leave.
%{help=rehash}%{+m}
###  %brehash%b
   Reloads the bot's config file, which resets all changes made via the
   %b'.set'%b command and reloads any Tcl scripts your config loads. It also
   saves and reloads the user file from disk, just to give it some exercise.

See also: save, reload, restart%{+n}, rehelp, relang
%{help=rehelp}%{+n}
###  %brehelp%b
   This command forces the bot to recheck all of its help files for changes.

See also: save, reload, restart, relang
%{help=relay}%{+o}
###  %brelay%b <botname>
   Relays you via telnet to another bot, whether or not it is currently linked.
   The local bot must, however, have a bot record for the bot you wish to
   relay to. Typing .quit or "*bye*" on a line by itself will end the relay.

See also: bots%{+t}, +bot, -bot
%{help=reload}%{+m|m}
###  %breload%b
   Reloads the bot's user file, discarding any changes made since the last
   %b'.save'%b command or hourly user file save. Sharebots should probably
   never do this.

See also: save%{+m}, rehash
%{help=traffic}%{+m|m}
###  %btraffic%b
   Shows total and daily net traffic stats since the last %b'.restart'%b.
   Stats groups are IRC, Botnet, Partyline, Transfer.mod and Misc.
%{+m}

See also: restart
%{help=whoami}%{-}
###  %bwhoami%b
   Shows your current handle and to what bot you are connected.

See also: whom
%{help=restart}%{+m}
###  %brestart%b
   Restarts the Tcl interpreter, wipes all timers, reloads all modules, and
   reloads the config file for the bot (which resets any changes made via the
   %b'.set'%b command and reloads any Tcl scripts your config loads). As with
   the %b'.rehash'%b command, it also saves and reloads the user file from disk.

See also: rehash, reload, save
%{help=save}%{+m|m}
###  %bsave%b
   This makes the bot write its entire userfile to disk. This is useful if you
   think the bot is about to crash or something, since the user file is only
   written to disk about once an hour.

See also: reload, rehash, backup
%{help=simul}%{+n}
###  %bsimul%b <handle> <text>
   This allows you to simulate the specified handle typing the given text.

   For example:
      .simul dweeb .quit

   This would appear just as if "dweeb" typed ".quit". This command will not
   work unless eggdrop has simul enabled in the config file. Please use this
   command ethically.
%{help=strip}%{-}
###  %bstrip%b [modes]
   Allows you to remove embedded 'attribute' codes your partyline output. Valid
   options are:
      %bb%b - remove all boldface codes
      %bc%b - remove all color codes
      %br%b - remove all reverse video codes
      %bu%b - remove all underline codes
      %ba%b - remove all ANSI codes
      %bg%b - remove all ctrl-g (bell) codes

   The mode can also be a modifier like '+c' or '-bu' or '+ru-c'. If
   you omit modes, it will show your current setting.

See also: fixcodes
%{+m}

###  %bstrip%b <user> [modes]
   Set the strip level of another user. A master can't set their own strip
   flags without prefixing the modes with a '+' or '-'.


%{help=su}%{-}
###  %bsu%b <user>
   Lets you assume the identity of another user. If you are a global owner,
   this does not require a password. Otherwise, you will be asked for the
   user's password. %b.quit%b returns you to your original handle.
%{help=trace}%{+t}
###  %btrace%b <bot>
   Sends out a trace signal to another bot. If/when the trace signal returns,
   (and it should!) you will get an output that looks something like this:
      Trace result -> Valis:Stonewall:NoBoty:SomeBoty

   This is a list of the bots connected between you and the destination bot.
   It should also return the time in seconds taken for the trace to occur.

See also: bots, bottree, vbottree
%{help=unlink}%{+t}
###  %bunlink%b <bot/*>
   This disconnects the specified bot from the botnet (assuming it was linked
   in the first place). Some bots (sharebots in particular) might not allow you
   to unlink them. If "*" is specified as the parameter, all bots will be
   unlinked.

See also: link, +bot, -bot, bots, bottree
%{help=unloadmod}%{+n}
###  %bunloadmod%b <module>
   Unloads the specified module.

See also: modules, module, loadmod
%{help=whom}%{-}
###  %bwhom%b [channel/*]
   Displays a list of users on the current partyline channel.

   For example:
      [23:12] #Wcc# whom
       Nick        Bot        Host
      ----------   ---------  --------------------
      *Wcc         Anakha     telnet@xxx.atlaga.adelphia.net [idle 8m]
      *Blah        Anakha     telnet@xxx.atlaga.adelphia.net
      Total users: 2

   Each user's nickname will be listed in the first column, preceded by a "*"
   if they are a bot owner, "+" if they are a master, "%%" if they are a botnet
   master, or "@" if they are an op. In the next column, the bot the user is
   connected to will be displayed. In the third column, the host is shown. If
   the user is away, the away message will be shown. Likewise, if they are
   idle, their idle time will be displayed.

   To see what users are on a different channel, you may specify a channel
   number/name. If you specify "*" as the channel, all users on all botnet
   channels will be shown.

See also: who, bots, chat
%{help=who}%{-}
###  %bwho%b [bot]
   Displays a list of users on the local bot.

   For example:
      [23:21] #Wcc# who
      Party line members:  (* = owner, + = master, @ = op)
      *Wcc       telnet@xxx.atlaga.adelphia.net (idle 17m)
      *Wcc       telnet@xxx.atlaga.adelphia.net
      Bots connected:
      -> wortel (05 Dec 16:32) eggdrop v1.6.15 <efnet>

   The first section is people on your current channel (the party line, if you
   haven't changed channels) who are on the bot. A '*' will precede the handle
   if they are a bot owner, "+" if they are a master, "%%" if they are a botnet
   master, or "@" if they are an op. The user's nickname, hostname, and
   possibly an idle time and/or away message will be displayed.%{+n} Owners
   will also see the user's dcc idx.%{-}

   The next section is bots directly linked to the current bot. The arrow
   indicates which bot initiated the connection. The right arrow means this bot
   connected to wortel. A left arrow means the remote bot linked to this bot. A
   '+' next to the arrow indicates that the bot is sharing userfiles with us.
   The connection time (05 Dec 16:32) and bot version are also shown, as well
   as what is specified under "network" in the config file.%{+n} Owners will
   also see the bot's dcc idx.%{-}

   The final section (not shown in example above) is a list of users on the
   local bot who are not on your channel. This will be omitted if there are no
   users on other channels. If you specify the name of a remote bot, for
   example %b'.who valis'%b, the who request will be sent to that bot instead.
   The remote bot must be linked to the botnet.
%{+m}

   Masters may also see "(con <flags>)" after a user's entry, which shows the
   user's console flags/modes (see %b'.help console'%b).

   In the final section (users that aren't on the current channel), masters
   will see the actual channels other users are on. Also, people in the
   filesystem will be listed (as being in channel "files") if the filesys
   module is loaded. A '+' next to the nickname here means the user has
   access to return to the party line.
%{-}

   The first line tells you the bot's name, what version of Eggdrop it's
   running, the number of users the bot has records of, and the amount of
   memory being used by the userfile. The second line tells you the uptime of
   the bot, CPU time, and cache hit. The third shows the bot's admin, and the
   forth shows its current config file. The fifth line shows what operating
   system the bot is running on. The next two lines show Tcl information. If
   debug mode is enabled, additional info may be shown. Sharing information
   will also be shown if it's being used.

   Select information from modules will be displayed after the core
   information. If you use %b'.status all'%b instead, you will see all status
   information available from loaded modules.
