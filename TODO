When you have done something on this list or done anything that
requires you to send a patch file please do the following:

- make the patch file by diff'ng eggdrop1.3 and your changed
  eggdrop directory, for example:
    
    diff -bur eggdrop1.3 patched1.3 > myfirstpatch
    
- please do not patch src/patch.h

- please do not renumber the TODO, instead just remove what you
  fixed or say that you have submitted a patch

- subscribe to the patch list at
  http://scrambled.eggheads.org/mailman/listinfo/patches

- and when you e-mail the patch (with a description) to
  patches@eggheads.org, please put

    PATCH: <patch name>
    
  in the subject line, this is because it makes it easier for us
  to track patch files.
  
  also send a description of your patch to eggdev@eggheads.org (don't
  attach your patch to it), so discussion about it will occur there
