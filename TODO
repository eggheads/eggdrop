1. SEGV with sharing. Don't know how to reproduce this bug, but it
occurs again and again (Found by TheUnknown). Here are two DEBUG files:

2. CTCP flood a bot, it ignores you, then channel flood, it won't kick
you. It should ignore CTCP and not ignore ALL (found by Plex/Harry).

note: there is no such thing as a CTCP ignore, will code this for
1.3.28. users.h - line 153, and detect_flood() in servmsg.c - line 283. <cybah>

--
3. +h flag seems to be redundant with .strip (confusing)

Status: SegFault is working on this

--
4. ./configure not detecting static tcl being incompatible with modules in
    some situations (ask details to Tothwolf).

Status: Mixter did a patch for this, however his method stopped the configure
        from working on all systems ...

--
5. +shared/+s flags need to be recoded. The way all this works seems to be
confusing for users.

NOTE: +shared is now default ... howver the +g share flag should be recode 
      because it tends to be rather buggy ...

Status: noone is working on this

--
6. some users asked for mIrc bantypes (1/2/3/4) for the eggdrop. A setting
has to be added to allow the bot-owner to choose the banmask type he wants
his bot to use. not before 1.3.28.

<drummer> .kickban command already supports different bantypes...

Status: noone is working on this

--
7. fix the eggdrop/tcl8.* info exist bug.

Status: noone is working on this

--
8. rewrite the eggdrop server queue, like Cybah's bot. not before 1.3.28.

Status: Cybah ?

--
9. From the eggheads list: <cybah>

I think there is a minor bug in the way
how botnets restructure...

dcc!leafy *** Unlinked oldhub (restructure)
dcc!leafy [17:13] ERROR linking newhub: Already connected.
dcc!leafy [17:13] Lost bot: newhub

problem here is, that they delink from the old hub
and link to the newly designated (or alternate) hub
immediately, but that hub doesnt have the information
that leafy unlinked from newhub yet (botnet lag), so it will
say error: already connceted. making the bots wait
for about 2 seconds before re-linking would fix this

There are some english sentences in the C src. They should be moved to
/language. We also need some coordination between the different
languages.

13. We need a better solution to the non-rfc-complient networks than to remove
    -DRFC_COMPLIENT from the Makefile. Need to make rfc_casecmp a pointer to a
    function and check net-type whenever the config file is loaded. Obviously
    with this approach, net-type has to be set readonly because we cant check
    when it's value is changed on a running bot. Anyone who changes it
    on-the-fly is mad anyway :p If net-type is set on a known non rfc-complient
    network, we just point rfc_casecmp at strcasecmp.. otherwise to the proper
    functions <Cybah>

Status: drummer submitted a patch to eggdev

14. after you end a relay session with a bot and your using a dcc
    connection, shouldn't eggdrop turn off telnet codes automatically?

15. This is an odd one, and I've included code that should reproduce it...
    (Tothwolf)
   =TestBot= [04:12] joined #TestChannel but didn't want to!

   bind time - "?0 * * * *" time:join:channel
   bind time - "?5 * * * *" time:join:channel
   proc time:join:channel {min hour day month year} {
     test:join:channel
     return 0
   }

   proc test:join:channel {} {
     channel add #TestChannel
     puthelp "PRIVMSG #TestChannel :I'm here!"
     timer 1 "catch {channel remove #TestChannel}"
