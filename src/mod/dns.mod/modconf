#### DNS MODULE (Deprecated) ####

## This module provided asynchronous dns support, but as of v1.9.2, this
## functionality was moved into the core code. If you are having issues with the
## new DNS functionality, or just want to continue using this module, compile
## Eggdrop with the --disable-tdns flag (./configure --disdable-tdns).
#
## You really probably don't want to uncomment this!!!!
