DESC:The blowfish module provides encryption and hashing support for eggdrop.
DESC:Eggdrop requires a module that provides hashing in order to run.
DESC:While the PBKDF2 module is the current recommended module for hashing,
DESC:you should still run this module if you want to use functions such as the
DESC:Tcl 'encrypt' command.
DESC:
DESC:Enable this module if you are transitioning from userfiles previously
DESC:created with the blowfish module, or are using Tcl scripts that use
DESC:the encrypt function.
