#### BLOWFISH MODULE ####
#
# This module is planned to be removed in Eggdrop 2.0
#
# Load this if you intend to use a pre-1.9.0 userfile (Or in other words, do
# not load this if you are starting this as a fresh bot and are not linking
# it to a botnet that uses blowfish hashes)
#
# You also need to load this if you use a script that employs the
# encrypt/decrypt Tcl commands.
#
loadmodule blowfish

# Specify whether to use ECB or CBC operation modes for the tcl commands
# 'encrypt' and 'decrypt'. Prior to version 1.9.0, the less secure ecb
# method was used by default. If you are using these commands with older bots,
# change this to 'ecb' for compatibility, or upgrade the older bots.
