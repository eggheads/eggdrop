#### CTCP MODULE ####

# This module provides the normal ctcp replies that you'd expect.
# Without it loaded, CTCP CHAT will not work. The server module
# is required for this module to function.
loadmodule ctcp

# Set here how the ctcp module should answer ctcps.
# Options are:
#   0 = Normal behavior is used.
#   1 = The bot ignores all ctcps, except for CHAT and PING requests
#       by users with the +o flag.
#   2 = Normal behavior is used, however the bot will not answer more
#       than X ctcps in Y seconds (defined by 'set flood-ctcp').
set ctcp-mode 0

# There are also several variables to help make your bot less noticeable.
# They are: ctcp-version, ctcp-finger, and ctcp-userinfo. You can use set to set
# them to values you'd like.
