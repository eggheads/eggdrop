#### TRANSFER MODULE ####

# The transfer module provides DCC SEND/GET support and userfile transfer
# support for userfile sharing. Un-comment the next line to load it if you
# need this functionality.

# Set here the maximum number of simultaneous downloads to allow for
# each user.
set max-dloads 3

# Set here the block size for dcc transfers. ircII uses 512 bytes,
# but admits that it may be too small. 1024 is standard these days.
# 0 is turbo-dcc (recommended).
set dcc-block 0

# Enable this setting if you want to copy files to a temporary location before
# sending or receiving them. This might be useful for file stability, but if
# your directories are NFS mounted, it's a pain. Setting this to 1 is not
# advised for big files or if you're low on disk space.
set copy-to-tmp 1

# Set here the time (in seconds) to wait before an inactive transfer times out.
set xfer-timeout 30

# By default, Eggdrop will abort the linking process if userfile sharing is
# enabled but the userfile transfer fails. Set this to 0 to keep the bots
# linked if the userfile transfer fails and retry every minute (both bots must
# be v1.9.0 or higher).
#set sharefail-unlink 1
