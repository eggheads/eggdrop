#### SERVER MODULE ####

# This module provides the core server support. You have to load this
# if you want your bot to come on IRC. Not loading this is equivalent
# to the old NO_IRC define.
loadmodule server

# Control certificate verification for irc servers. For a description of the
# possible values, look at the SSL SETTINGS section above.
#set ssl-verify-server 0

## What is your network?
## Options are:
##   EFnet
##   IRCnet
##   Undernet
##   DALnet
##   Libera
##   freenode
##   QuakeNet
##   Rizon
##   Twitch (This requires twitch.mod to be loaded as well)
##   Other  (This is a good, sane default option to use if your network/ircd is
##          not listed here. Additional configuration options for this setting
##          can be found further down in the IRC MODULE section)
set net-type "EFnet"

# Set the nick the bot uses on IRC, and on the botnet unless you specify a
# separate botnet-nick, here.
set nick "Lamestbot"

# Set the alternative nick which the bot uses on IRC if the nick specified
# by 'set nick' is unavailable. All '?' characters will be replaced by random
# numbers.
set altnick "Llamab?t"

# Set what should be displayed in the real-name field for the bot on IRC.
# This can not be blank, it has to contain something.
set realname "/msg LamestBot hello"

# This is a Tcl script to be run immediately after connecting to a server. If
# you want to authenticate Eggdrop with NickServ, uncomment and edit the middle
# line below.

# This is the bot's server list. The bot will start at the first server listed,
# and cycle through them whenever it gets disconnected. You need to change these
# servers to YOUR network's servers.
#
# The format is:
#   server add <server> [port [password]]
# Prefix the port with a plus sign to attempt a SSL connection:
#   server add <server> +port [password]
#
# Both the port and password fields are optional. If a port isn't specified,
# the default-port setting will be used. If you want to set a password or use
# SSL, you must specify a port.
#
# This format is new as of version 1.9.0. The previous method using
# set servers {} will still work for now, but is deprecated and will be removed
# in a future release.

#### CAP Features ####
# This section controls IRCv3 capabilities supported natively by Eggdrop. You
# can enable individual settings here to be requested as part of the
# registration process with the IRC server. Not all servers support all CAP
# features. https://ircv3.net/support/networks.html maintains a list of some
# popular servers, and you can also use '.tcl cap ls' from the partyline
# to list capabilities available on that server.
#
# The capabilities currently known to be supported by Eggdrop are as follows:
#
#  account-notify, account-tag, away-notify, chghost, echo-message,
#  extended-join, invite-notify, message-tags, server-time, sasl, setname,
#  +typing
#

# SASL is a method that allows Eggdrop to authenticate with a NickServ service
# as part of the connection process to a server, eliminating the need to later
# authenticate via a /msg command.
#
# To request SASL authentication via CAP, set this to 1
#set sasl 0

# Set SASL mechanism to authenticate with.
# Options are:
#   0 = PLAIN                       (normal user/pass exchange, only encrypted
#                                    if connected to the IRC server with a
#                                    SSL/TLS connection)
#
#   1 = ECDSA-NIST256P-CHALLENGE    (Uses a certificate; usually requires a
#                                    public key to be registered with NickServ
#                                    or other similar service. Set certificate
#                                    to use in sasl-ecdsa-key setting below)
#
#   2 = EXTERNAL                    (Some other method you set up. Certificates
#                                    used are defined in ssl-certificate and
#                                    ssl-privatekey settings in SSL section)
#
#set sasl-mechanism 0

# Set username to authenticate to IRC NickServ with
#set sasl-username "llamabot"

# Set password to authenticate to IRC NickServ with
#set sasl-password "password"

# Specify the location of certificate to use for the SASL
# ecdsa-nist256p-challenge. An ECDSA certificate can be generated with the
# command:
#   openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out eggdrop-ecdsa.pem
#set sasl-ecdsa-key "eggdrop-ecdsa.pem"

# Set SASL failure action
# If SASL authentication fails, do you want to connect to the server anyway?
# Set this to 0 to disconnect and retry until success, or 1 to continue
# connecting to the server without SASL authentication.
#set sasl-continue 1
#
# Timeout (in seconds) before giving up SASL authentication
#set sasl-timeout 15

# To request the account-notify feature via CAP, set this to 1
#set account-notify 0

# To request the account-notify feature via CAP, set this to 1
#set extended-join 0

# To request the invite-notify feature via CAP, set this to 1
#set invite-notify 0

# To request the message-tags feature via CAP, set this to 1. NOTE: Enabling
# this feature may interfere with RAW binds in scripts.
#set message-tags 0

# If you have any additional CAP features you would like to request at
# registration but are not listed above, set them here as space separated
# strings. Setting features here does not guarantee Eggdrop's ability to support
# them.
#set cap-request "feature1 feature2 feature3"

#### End of CAP features ####

# Number of seconds to wait between transmitting queued lines to the server.
# Lower this value at your own risk.  ircd is known to start flood control
# at 512 bytes/2 seconds.
set msg-rate 2

# This setting makes the bot try to get his original nickname back if its
# primary nickname is already in use.
set keep-nick 1

# This setting makes the bot squelch the error message when rejecting a DCC
# CHAT, SEND or message command. Normally, Eggdrop notifies the user that the
# command has been rejected because they don't have access. Note that sometimes
# IRC server operators detect bots that way.
set quiet-reject 1

# If you want your bot to answer lower case ctcp requests (non rfc-
# compliant), set this setting to 1. mIRC will do this, most other
# clients will not.
set lowercase-ctcp 0

# Set how many ctcps should be answered at once.
set answer-ctcp 3

# Set here how many msgs in how many seconds from one host constitutes
# a flood. If you set this to 0:0, msg flood protection will be disabled.
set flood-msg 5:60

# Set here how many ctcps in how many seconds from one host constitutes
# a flood. If you set this to 0:0, ctcp flood protection will be disabled.
set flood-ctcp 3:60

# This setting defines how long Eggdrop should wait before moving from one
# server to another on disconnect. If you set 0 here, Eggdrop will not wait
# at all and will connect instantly. Setting this too low could result in
# your bot being K:Lined.
set server-cycle-wait 60

# Set here how long Eggdrop should wait for a response when connecting to a
# server before giving up and moving on to next server.
set server-timeout 60

# Set this to 1 if Eggdrop should check for stoned servers? (where the
# server connection has died, but Eggdrop hasn't been notified yet).
set check-stoned 1

# If you want your bot to exit the server if it receives an ERROR message,
# set this to 1.
set serverror-quit 1

# Set here the maximum number of lines to queue to the server. If you're
# going to dump large chunks of text to people over IRC, you will probably
# want to raise this. 300 is fine for most people though.
set max-queue-msg 300

# If you want Eggdrop to trigger binds for ignored users, set this to 1.
set trigger-on-ignore 0

# This setting configures PUBM and MSGM binds to be exclusive of PUB and MSG
# binds. This means if a MSGM bind with the mask "*help*" exists and is
# triggered, any MSG bindings with "help" in their mask will not be
# triggered. Don't enable this unless you know what you are doing!
set exclusive-binds 0

# This optimizes the kick queue. It also traces nick changes and parts in
# the channel and changes the kick queue accordingly.
# Options are:
#   0 = Turn it off.
#   1 = Optimize the kick queue by summarizing kicks.
#   2 = Trace nick changes and parts on the channel and change the queue
#       accordingly. For example, bot will not try to kick users who have
#       already parted the channel.
# ATTENTION: Setting 2 is very CPU intensive.
set optimize-kicks 1

# If your network supports more recipients per command then 1, you can

### SERVER MODULE - OTHER NETWORKS (net-type "Other") ###

# This settings defines how umode +r is understood by Eggdrop. Some networks
# use +r to indicate a restricted connection. If this is your case, and you
# want your bot to leave restricted servers and jump to the next server on its
# list, then set it to 1. The default setting is 0.
#set check-mode-r 0

# This setting allows you to specify the maximum nick-length supported by your
# network. The default setting is 9. The maximum supported length by Eggdrop
# is 32.
#set nick-len 9
