#### UPTIME MODULE ####

# This module reports uptime statistics to http://uptime.eggheads.org.
# Go look and see what your uptime is! It takes about 9 hours to show up,
# so if your bot isn't listed, try again later. The server module must be
# loaded for this module to function.
#
# Information sent to the server includes the bot's uptime, botnet-nick,
# server, version, and IP address. This information is stored in a temporary
# logfile for debugging purposes only. The only publicly available information
# will be the bot's botnet-nick, version and uptime. If you do not wish for this
# information to be sent, comment out the following line.
