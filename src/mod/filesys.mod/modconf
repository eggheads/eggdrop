#### FILESYSTEM MODULE ####

# This module provides an area within the bot where users can store and
# manage files. With this module, the bot is usable as a file server. The
# transfer module is required for this module to function. Un-comment
# the following line to load the filesys module.
loadmodule filesys

# Set here the 'root' directory for the file system.
set files-path "/home/mydir/filesys"

# If you want to allow uploads, set this to the directory uploads
# should be put into. Set this to "" if you don't want people to
# upload files to your bot.
set incoming-path "/home/mydir/filesys/incoming"

# If you don't want to have a central incoming directory, but instead
# want uploads to go to the current directory that a user is in, set
# this setting to 1.
set upload-to-pwd 0

# Eggdrop creates a '.filedb' file in each subdirectory of your file area
# to keep track of its own file system information. If you can't do that (for
# example, if the dcc path isn't owned by you, or you just don't want it to do
# that) specify a path here where you'd like all of the database files to be
# stored instead.
set filedb-path ""

# Set here the maximum number of people that can be in the file area at once.
# Setting this to 0 makes it effectively infinite.
set max-file-users 20

# Set here the maximum allowable file size that will be received (in KB).
# Setting this to 0 makes it effectively infinite.
set max-filesize 1024
