#### COMPRESS MODULE ####

# This module provides support for file compression. This allows the
# bot to transfer compressed user files and therefore save a significant amount
# of bandwidth. The share module must be loaded to load this module. Un-comment
# the following line to the compress module.
loadmodule compress

# Allow compressed sending of user files? The user files are compressed with
# the compression level defined in `compress-level'.
set share-compressed 1

# This is the default compression level used. These levels are the same as
# those used by GNU gzip.
#set compress-level 9
