#### IDENT MODULE ####

# This module adds Eggdrop support for the externally-provided oident
# service, or alternatively the ability for Eggdrop to act as its own ident
# daemon. Please read the docs at doc/settings/mod.ident for additional
# information on correctly configuring this section. If you don't know
# what ident or oident are, it is safe to leave this section commented.
loadmodule ident

# Set the ident method you wish to use. Each of these methods requires
# some form of external configuration in order to function. See
# doc/settings/mod.ident for additional information.
# Options are:
#   0 = oidentd
#         Your bot will overwrite $HOME/.oidentd.conf right before opening the
#         socket to the IRC server with the global reply.
#         NOTE: requires the oidentd service to be running on the host machine
#   1 = Builtin
#         Your bot will automatically turn its builtin identd on and off when
#         needed so it shouldn't conflict with other identds that do the same.
#         NOTE: Eggdrop must be granted permissions on the host system to bind
#         to port 113. 
#set ident-method 0

# Set the ident port to use for ident-method 1.
#set ident-port 113
