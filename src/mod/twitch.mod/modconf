#### TWITCH MODULE ####

# This module attempts to provide connectivity with the Twitch gaming platform.
# While Twitch provides an IRC gateway to connect with it's streaming service,
# it does not claim to (and certainly does not) follow the IRC RFC in any
# meaningful way. The intent of this module is not to provide the full spectrum
# of management functions typically associated with Eggdrop; please see the docs
# for additional information. Only load this if you are connecting to Twitch!
# Please see doc/TWITCH for Twitch-specific setup information, like how to
# configure the required CAP settings in the IRC section above.
