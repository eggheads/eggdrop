###  %bshare howto%b
   First you need to decide two things:
     %b1.%b Which bot will be 'active' and which 'passive'.
        The active bot will SEND a userfile to the passive bot. %bThe passive%b
        %bbot's userfile will be overwritten.%b We shall call the %bACTIVE%b bot
        "A", and the %bPASSIVE%b bot B.

     %b2.%b Which channels you want to share between the 2 bots. ALL global
        info will be shared, but only the channels you mark as shared will be
        shared.

   Steps:
     %b1.%b For each channel you want to share, do:

           .chanset #channel +shared

     %b2.%b On bot A, type:
     
           '.botattr B +s' (+s means actively share)

     %b3.%b On bot B, type:

           '.botattr A +p' (+p means passively share)

     %b4.%b For each channel you want shared between the two, do the following:

           On bot A, type: '.botattr B |+s #channel'
           On bot B, type: '.botattr A |+p #channel'

     %b5.%b Link them together; they should start sharing immediately.
%{help=flush}%{+n}
###  %bflush%b <bot>
   This clears the resync buffer for a share-bot. This is useful if you want
   to start over with a userfile transfer. You can unlink the sharebots, flush
   the resync buffer, and relink.
