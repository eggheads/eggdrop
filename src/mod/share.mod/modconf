#### SHARE MODULE ####

# This module provides userfile sharing support between two directly
# linked bots. The transfer and channels modules are required for this
# module to correctly function. Un-comment the following line to load
# the share module.
loadmodule share

# Settings in this section must be un-commented before setting.

# When two bots get disconnected, this setting allows them to create a
# resync buffer which saves all changes done to the userfile during
# the disconnect. When they reconnect, they will not have to transfer
# the complete user file, but, instead, just send the resync buffer.
#
# NOTE: This has been known to cause loss of channel flags and other
# problems. Using this setting is not recommended.
#set allow-resync 0

# This setting specifies how long to hold another bots resync data
# before flushing it.
#set resync-time 900

# When sharing user lists, DON'T ACCEPT global flag changes from other bots?
# NOTE: The bot will still send changes made on the bot, it just won't accept
# any global flag changes from other bots. This overrides the private-globals
# setting (below).
#set private-global 0

# When sharing user lists, if private-global isn't set, which global flag
# changes from other bots should be ignored?
#set private-globals "mnot"

# When sharing user lists, don't accept ANY userfile changes from other
# bots? Paranoid people should use this feature on their hub bot. This
# will force all userlist changes to be made via the hub.
#set private-user 0

# This setting makes the bot discard its own bot records in favor of
# the ones sent by the hub.
# NOTE: No passwords or botflags are shared, only ports and
# address are added to sharing procedure. This only works with hubs that
# are v1.5.1 or higher.
#set override-bots 0
