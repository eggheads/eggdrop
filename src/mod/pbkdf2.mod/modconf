#### PBKDF2 MODULE ####

# IF YOU DON'T READ THIS YOU MAY RENDER YOUR USERFILE USELESS LATER
# Eggdrop uses hashing in the userfile, so users can have secure passwords.
# Eggdrop will not start without an encryption module.
#
# As of Eggdrop 1.9.0, a new module was added for hashing, the PBKDF2 module.
# The PBKDF2 module was designed to work with the previous encryption module
# (blowfish) to make the transition easier. If this is a new bot, you can
# safely load just the PBKDF2 module. If you are transitioning a userfile from
# 1.8 or earlier, you should load this AND the blowfish module (below). By doing
# so, Eggdrop will seamlessly update the old blowfish hashes to the new PBKDF2
# hashes once a user logs in for the first time, and allow you to (eventually)
# remove the blowfish module altogether (See the remove-pass setting).

# Outside of the specific case noted above, please note that if you change your
# encryption method later (i.e. using other modules like a rijndael module), you
# can't use your current userfile anymore.
#
# NOTE FOR BOTNET USERS: If all bots on the botnet are not running the same
# configuration settings for encryption, you may encounter password-related
# issues when linking.

# Number of rounds. The higher the number, the longer hashing takes; but also
# the higher the protection against brute force attacks.

# Remove old password hashes after updating to a pbkdf2 hash?
#
# WARNING: DO NOT CHANGE THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
# Enabling this setting will break compatibility with older Eggdrops by ceasing
# to write to the PASS field (where password hashes from modules like blowfish
# are stored), as well as remove an existing PASS hash if found when writing a
# new pbkdf2 hash. In some scenarios (for example, a hub sharing a userfile to
# a leaf that does not have a pbkdf2 module loaded) enabling this setting may
# result in a user having no password set at all.
#
# This setting is planned to be enabled by default in Eggdrop 2.0.
