4.1) The logged last context (example: Last context: userent.c/973 []):

4.2) If the bot wrote to the file DEBUG, copy the text -contents- of
     that file here (NOTE: It should be about 20 lines of info, but it
     could be a few lines more):

4.3) Your comments and a description of the bug:

4.4) Can you cause the bug condition to repeat? If so, please outline
     step by step what causes the error:

     Please list them:

4.6) Do you have ideas on how to correct it?  Please list them:

4.7) Other comments?

4.8) If the bot dumped a 'core' file when it crashed, it would be *very*
     useful if you could paste gdb's output during the following steps:
     First call gdb
         $ gdb eggdrop -c core
     (systemd users could try coredumpctl)
     and then enter 'bt' on gdb's command line:
         (gdb) bt
     (even more information could be obtained with 'bt full')
     Keep your core file for at least one week, so that the dev team
     can ask for further information if needed. However, don't send
     us the core file unless we ask for it.

     NOTE: If this is a bug you can reproduce, please compile with
           make debug and follow the above step. It can greatly help
           find and fix the bug.
