assoc

    This module provides assoc support, i.e. naming channels on the
    botnet.

blowfish

    Eggdrop can encrypt your userfile, so users can have secure
    passwords. Please note that when you change your encryption method
    later (i.e. using other modules like a md5 module), you can't use
    your current userfile anymore. Eggdrop will not start without an
    encryption module.

channels

    This module provides channel related support for the bot. Without
    it, you won't be able to make the bot join a channel or save channel
    specific userfile information.

compress

    This module provides support for file compression. This allows the
    bot to transfer compressed user files and, therefore, save a
    significant amount of bandwidth.

console

    This module provides storage of console settings when you exit the
    bot or type .store on the partyline.

ctcp

    This module provides the normal ctcp replies that you'd expect.
    Without it loaded, CTCP CHAT will not work.

dns

    This module provides asynchronous dns support. This will avoid long
    periods where the bot just hangs there, waiting for a hostname to
    resolve, which will often let it timeout on all other connections.

filesys

    This module provides an area within the bot where users can store
    and manage files. With this module, the bot is usable as a file
    server.

irc

    This module provides basic IRC support for your bot. You have to
    load this if you want your bot to come on IRC.

notes

    This module provides support for storing of notes for users from
    each other. Note sending between currently online users is supported
    in the core, this is only for storing the notes for later retrieval.

seen

    This module provides very basic seen commands via msg, on channel or
    via dcc. This module works only for users in the bot's userlist. If
    you are looking for a better and more advanced seen module, try the
    gseen module by G'Quann. You can find it at
    http://www.kreativrauschen.com/gseen.mod/.

server

    This module provides the core server support. You have to load this
    if you want your bot to come on IRC. Not loading this is equivalent
    to the old NO_IRC define.

share

    This module provides userfile sharing support between two directly
    linked bots.

transfer

    The transfer module provides DCC SEND/GET support and userfile
    transfer support for userfile sharing.

twitch

    The Twitch module modifies Eggdrop to interact with the Twitch
    service. Twitch uses a modified implementation of IRC so not all
    functionality will be present. Please read doc/TWITCH for specifics
    on how to best use the Tiwtch module.

uptime

    This module reports uptime statistics to the uptime contest web site
    at http://uptime.eggheads.org. Go look and see what your uptime is!
    It takes about 9 hours to show up, so if your bot isn't listed, try
    again later. See doc/settings/mod.uptime for more information,
    including details on what information is sent to the uptime server.

woobie

    This is for demonstrative purposes only. If you are looking for
    starting point in writing modules, woobie is the right thing.
