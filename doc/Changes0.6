Eggdrop Changes (starting with 0.6c)

    _____________________________________________________________________

0.6r (April 4, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - When switching servers, it used to think it was on the channel again
    even if it wasn't -- fixed

  - Used to crash when receiving really long one-word msgs -- fixed


0.6q (April 2, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - 'pass' with 2 parameters changes your password now

  - 'info' with no parameters shows your current info

  - Host masking is better now

  - Master-command '.info' to retrieve someone's info

  - New msg command 'who' to show all users info


0.6p (April 1, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - 'help' works a little better but is still sparse

  - 'pass', 'info', 'ident' cleaned up and show standard-looking console
    entries now

  - 'op' and 'invite' converted to standard console entries

  - Can't set your password too long now

  - New command '.match' to look up users by matching a nickname wildcard,
    or by attributes (precede with '+': ie, '+m' to find masters)


0.6o (March 31, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - 'hello' actually programmed in :)

  - People recognized by the bot (who have a password set) can get a new
    hostmask recognized via msg: 'ident <password>'

  - People who get lost in netsplits aren't logged with log-joins=off now
    (oops)

  - New file misc.c created to better modularize the code

  - 'pass <password>' from someone the bot knows who doesn't have a password
    set, will set a password for them

  - 'info <etc>' will set your join info, assuming the bot is using infofile


0.6n (March 30, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - (happy birthday brandon!)

  - 'yes'/'no'/'true'/'false'/'y'/'n'/'t'/'f' can be used in SET

  - learn-users (new set variable) allows new members to the channel to send
    a 'hello' to the bot and get in the user list (if not already there)

  - Very pointless old helpbot code removed -- no plans for any helpbot
    support in the future


0.6m (March 28, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - 'host unreachable' trapped now


0.6l (March 22, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - New configfile variable 'infofile' for user info lines

  - New configfile set 'greet' to turn on/off auto-greet using the infofile
    (will check the infofile for a handle that matches the one found for the
    user joining, and if found, will dump that line to the channel)


0.6k (March 17, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - Remembers what dcc directory you were last in (stored in user file)

  - Fixed extra-space bug in updating file list

  - Will show handle in '.channel' if it can find one for that user

  - Can change description now, but still can't add one

  - Time/date stamps notes in the notefile

  - desc works now


0.6j (March 16, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - '.note' works for non-masters now (it was supposed to all along)

  - A '.note' while that user is online is treated like a private message --
    that was always true -- but now it looks more like one

  - Ban list in '.channel' tries to conserve space now, and should show bans
    placed by servers (instead of claiming "unknown")

  - Acknowledges successful file receive and adds it to the incoming
    directory list now


0.6i (March 14, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - Won't babble about how it's reversing illegal mode changes if it's not
    even op'd

  - mkdir/rmdir work now

  - 60 seconds flood instead of 1 for flood detect (and it works now)


0.6h (March 11, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - Fixed dcc chat connection to IP numbers -- it works now (hostname lookup
    not required)

  - Config parameter 'dccdir' changed to 'dcc-path' (this is the start
    location of any file transfer user)

  - New config parameter 'dcc-incoming' which is the path to store uploaded
    files -- if you leave it undefined, nobody can upload

  - Made it so the master-only file system commands actually require you to
    be a master (oops)

  - New file system commands: 'import', 'hide', 'rm', 'mkdir', 'rmdir' for
    masters (file system is starting to become a bit more respectable)

  - Eggdrop will warn you if it doesn't understand (and therefore is going
    to ignore) a line in its config file

  - Extra frivolous command '.me' added (public actions)


0.6g (March 10, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - Removed old clumsy and stupid ignore code

  - People on the ignore list only have msgs, notices, and ctcp's ignored
    now, not vital information like kicks, joins, etc (duh)

  - Flooding via msg or notice is activated by 5 from the same host in 1
    second, and results in that host being added to the ingore list

  - Flooding a channel with msgs, notices, or nick changes is activated by
    10 from the same host in 1 second, and results in a kick from the
    channel

  - Flooding via ctcp (to the bot or channel) is activated by 5 from the
    same host in 1 second, and results in that host being added to the
    ignore list, AND the user being kicked from the channel, if they are on
    it


0.6f (March 9, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - New command line option -c when used with -n, which will dump a
    '.channel' and '.status' output to the terminal every 10 seconds

  - New command line option -t when used with -n, which makes the terminal
    appear as another member of the party line

  - Mode changes made by someone who gained ops via server (and isn't in the
    op-list) are reversed and a kick is sent out for them -- an auto-deop is
    sent out for each invalid server op but sometimes users can make quick
    mode changes before the deop propogates -- this controls the damage


0.6e (March 7, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - Got rid of warning messages from net.c

  - Only shows nickname of person who placed the ban in '.channel'

  - Shortened date/time listing in '.channel' of when a user joined the
    channel -- now it's "15:45" or "14Mar" or "dunno"

  - No longer crashes horribly when it can't get the telnet port it wants
    (used to go into an infinite loop!)

  - The 'log' command now can be used as 'log <from> <to>' which will show
    you log entries from <from> mins ago until <to> mins ago

  - Fixed ignore bug (ignore works now on users who also have an entry in
    the user list)

  - If it can't get the telnet port it wants, it will keep trying the next
    port till it's tried 20 -- THEN it will give up; ie configfile port 2000
    could get assigned port 2000 through 2020

  - Five msgs/etc from the same host in one second are now considered a
    flood and get that host put on the ignore list

  - Closes dcc sockets on dying now (oops!)


0.6d (March 3, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - IP number connections were using negative values (eek!) - fixed

  - No more "mode change on nonexistant" when kickbanning

  - 'op' and 'deop' won't let you op/deop people not on the channel, or op a
    deop-listed person, or deop and op-listed person

  - Now supports server entries like 'hub.cs.jmu.edu:6665' to allow other
    ports besides 6667

  - Can msg bot 'invite [pass]' to get invited to a +i channel

  - Separated a new file 'users.c' from 'chanprog.c' to keep modularity

  - New notes function... store notes for masters or op-listers when they're
    offline: configfile 'notefile <etc>' -- command '.note <to> <msg>'

  - New command 'log [#]' will show the log file for the past # minutes (or
    default of 60 = 1 hour)


0.6c (March 2, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - Tried to fix hostname lookup for dcc chat - will attempt to connect via
    IP number now

  - New +console,-console to turn on/off console for non-masters

  - Fixed (?) bus error when -ignore or -ban on the last ignore/ban

  - Using -master or +master on someone on the party line will now have an
    immediate effect (no more leaving & rejoining)
