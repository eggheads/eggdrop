I. ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT

The purpose of this document is to show you what a botnet is for and why
it could be useful for you. It also covers botflags and some sharing
information which you may need for making your bots faster and more reliable.




II. TERMS USED

The following are some common terms used in this document.
If applicable, there is also the associated command named.


 Botnet
  The term used to describe multiple bots connected together.


 Link
  The term that means the actual linking of one bot

  commands: ".link <botname>" ".unlink <botname>"


 Hub
  A bot is described as a hub-bot, if one or more bots are linked to
  it.


 Leaf
  A leaf is a non-hub bot connecting to another bot. A leaf has only
  one other bot connected to it, its hub.  Leaf bots can be assigned
  the "l" botattr flag to prevent other bots from linking to them.


 Link Bot
  A link bot is a bot that is linked to another.  It may or may not be
  a hubbot, with other bots linked to it besides its hub.


 Share
  The term used to describe two bots sharing user records.


 Share Bots
  Share bots is a term used to describe two or more bots sharing user
  records.


 Aggressive Share
  Term used to describe the direction of sharing user-files.
  Aggressive share bots will SEND userfiles to another passive bot.


 Passive Share
  Term used to describe the direction of sharing user-files.
  Passive share bots will accept userfiles from an active/aggressive bot.


Note:  With eggdrop1.3.x and up, active/passive designations are relative, not
absolute like the prior versions of eggdrop bots, like 1.1.5. A 1.3+ bot may
be both active and passive at the same time, in relation to other bots it is
connected to.

example bottree:

superbot
    |
    \+intermed
         |
         \+peonbot

intermed has a master sharebot, superbot and a slave sharebot, peonbot.
intermed is passive with [receives from] superbot while being aggressive
with [sends to] peonbot at the same time.


 Flags
  Flags are attributes that determine what a bot can or is allowed to do.
  Flags can be either global (+s) or channel specific (|+s #lamest).
  Botnet affecting flags are:

  s   share (Aggressively SEND userfile to a passive bot (assigned +s flag))
  p   share (Passively ACCEPT userfile from an agressive bot (assigned +p flag))
  g   global share (share all channels (this works correctly in 1.4.xx))
  h   hub (bot is auto-linked)
  a   alternate (bot is auto-linked if the hub bot can't be linked)
  l   leaf (bot is not allowed to link in other bots)
  r   reject (bot will not be allowed on the net)
  i   isolate (isolate the party line across a botlink)
  0-9 user (user defined flags)

  command: ".botattr <botname> [(.+<flag> [#channel]) or (.-<flag> [#channel])]"


 Address
  The physical address, containing the host and port address of the bot.
  i.e. lame.org:3333

  command: ".chaddr <botname> <hostaddress:botport[/userport]>"


 Relay
  The relay port number of the bot if defined in the config file.
 Note that you can define one for telnet connections to other bots
 and one for relay connections.


 Relay connection
 A relay connection is used to relay (jump) to another bot in DCC chat.
 You can still relay to  another bot even if this is not defined in the
 conf file.

 command: ".relay <botname>"


 Port
  The telnet port is used by the bot to communicate with other bots and/or
  users. Note that you can define two separate ports for user and bot
  connections.




III. WHAT IS A BOTNET FOR?

Basically a botnet is useful if you want to use more then one bot to protect
your channel.  Bots linked a botnet can perform script controlled tasks.
Such a script can be get-ops (ops each bot in a botnet) or some kind of a
prevent-flood stuff. Just take a look at the script directories on
ftp://ftp.eggheads.org and you'll find a lot of botnet scripts.

Also, linked bots can share common user records (global or channel specific)
between each other which helps reduce the time needed to maintain a
complete, up to date user record database, needed if you operate your
channels in a +bitch mode. However, a warning - such sharing, with current
designs, may allow a user on one bot, even a slave bot to alter, change or
manipulate the entire botnet userfiles and use the botnet to take control of
your channel away from you.




IV. ADDING AND LINKING BOTS

With the common terms out of the way we can start with the process of
linking two bots. Before you start you have to know the following:

        -  What are the domains and ports of the bots.

Let's say there is BotA on lame.org listening to port 3333 and BotB
on irc.org listening to port 4444. Now you have to add each Bot to the
other's userfile (including hostmask, address and listening port of the
other bot). In BotA's console you have to type ".+bot BotB irc.org:4444"
(assuming that BotB is in the channel and so the hostmask is grabbed
automatically, otherwise you have to add it manually with ".+host") and on
BotB's console ".+bot BotA lame.org:3333".
At this point you can link them for the first time manually by typing
".link BotA" on BotB's console (or in reverse, of course with BotB ".link BotB"
on BotA's console). The bots will give themselves now randomized passwords,
which are *not* stored encrypted in the userfile. Now you've generated your
first botnet.
Note that you can add and link as much Bots as you want to your botnet.




V       USING BOTFLAGS

Botflags are needed to assign special functions and tasks to your bots.

 "h" (hub)
  If you want your bots to auto-link after getting unlinked or started (due
  to a crash or a server reboot), you have to assign the botattr +h to the
  bot you want the bot to link to.
  Note, you can assign +h only to one bot at a time!

  command: ".botattr <botname> +h"


 "a" (alternate)
  If your bots are for some reason not able to link to their hub, they will
  attempt to connect to an other "alternate-hub", which you can define by
  setting "+a" on one bot.
  Note, you can assign +a only to one bot at a time!

  command: ".botattr <botname> +a"


 "l" flag (leaf)
  This flag assigned to a link bot will cause your bot to unlink the leaf
  one, if it allows any other bots to link to it.

  command: ".botattr <botname> +l"


 "r" flag (reject)
  If you assign this flag to a bot, it won't be tolerated on your botnet and
  will be unlinked, if it tries to link to your one or any other bot.

  command: ".botattr <botname> +r"


 "i" flag (isolate)
  Setting this flag to a bot will effect an isolation of the partyline
  between your bot(net) and the other bot(net).

  command: ".botattr <botname> +i"


 "0-9" flag (user)
  These 10 flags aren't hardcoded into eggdrop and can be assigned by scripts
  or just for fun :-)

  command: ".botattr <botname> +(0-9)"


 "s" flag (SEND userfile to bots assigned the +s flag)
   +s   If you set on BotA's console BotB +s then BotA will try to send his
        userfile (parts selected by |s and g flags) aggressively to BotB.

        command: ".botattr <botname> +s"

   |s   With this flag you can define channels, which you want your bots
        to share.
        Note that you can use this flag only on +s bots!

        command: ".botattr <botname> |s #lamest"

 "p" flag (ACCEPT userfile FROM bots assigned the +p flag)
  If you assign this flag to another bot, your bot will accept userfiles
  sent from the aggressive bot (as much as you've allowed with |+s or +g)

        command: ".botattr <botname> +p"


 "g" flag (global share)
  If you set this flag on your +s or +p bot, |s and |+s are getting obsolete.
  Every ban and every user on every single channel will be transfered/accepted.

        command: ".botattr <botname> +g"




VI      MAKE TWO BOTS SHARE USER RECORDS

Before you start preparing your bots for sharing, you have to make sure that
you've loaded the transfer, share and filesys module into your bot (look
through the conf). You also have to ensure that the channel, which user records
should be shared, is set +shared.

When you are adding bot attribute flags to yourbot for other bots to be
linked, so that they will all share a common userfile, you cannot dictate
how the other link bots will react by setting botattr flag for them in
yourbot.  You can only control how you want yourbot to react to those bots
when they link.

By setting specific botattr flags, you can cause yourbot to be aggressive
with some link bots and to be passive with other link bots.

But remember, no botattr settings in yourbot have any control over how the
other bots will react with yourbot.

For sharing to work, the flags must be cordinated with one bot agreeing to
be passive and accept and the other link bot agreeing to send or share it's
userfile.  No setting in yourbot can force another bot to accept files
yourbot tries to send nor can any such flag force another bot to send or
share it userfile.  It has to be by mutual agreement to work.  Each bot has
total control of it own userfile sending and receiving functions.

Two primary botattr flags establish the pecking order, +s and +p, defining
which bot, by mutual agreement, is to be the aggressive/active bot that
sends the master userfile and which will bots will be passive and accept the
shared userfile.

Yourbot will send userfiles to any others set to botattr +s.
Yourbot will accept userfiles from any bot set to botattr +p.

Active/aggressive bots send userfiles to link bots with the +s botattr flag.
If those bots have the botattr of such an active bot set to +p, then they
will passively accept the aggressive sender's userfile.

In yourbot, setting slavebot +s will not make slavebot accept yourbot's
userfile.  It will only make yourbot attempt to send your userfile to
slavebot if they link.

In yourbot, setting masterbot +p will not make masterbot send its userfile
to yourbot.  The +p flag only gives masterbot permission to send yourbot a
userfile, if masterbot chooses to send one.

If you set slavebot +s, then yourbot will try to send slavebot your
userfile, once a minute until a successful tranfer is made.  If slavebot has
not given you write/send permission by adding the +p for yourbot, then
slavebot will refuse to accept yourbot's repeated offer to send.  Each and
every minute you will see this message repeated on yourbot's console:

<yourbot> [04:54] User file rejected by Slavebot: You are not marked for
sharing with me.

With these setting in yourbot:
     masterbot +p  [yourbot will be passive with masterbot]
     slavebot +s   [yourbot will be aggressive with slavebot]

On connection to slavebot, slavebot does not ask yourbot to send it
userfile.  Yourbot is aggressive in relation to slavebot and on linking,
yourbot automatically attempts to send its userfile to slavebot without any
request and will try to do so every 60 seconds until slavebot accepts the
userfile and a successful transfer is completed.

On connection to masterbot, yourbot does not ask master to send.  If
masterbot decides to send, yourbot gives permission and will accept any
userfile masterbot might send.

If the flags in both bots do not make a +s+p pair, the bots will link but
will not share.  If the +s+p pair is set properly, but the userfile transfer
fails for some reason, the bots will unlink.  If with has a +h or +a hub
flag set for the other, that bot will seek to relink and upon connection,
another attempt to share will be made.  If sucessful, the bots will then
stay linked and all will be well with the world.  :)



Note that by sharing user records, you also share automatically bans and
ignores (globally or channel specific) with the other bot. Botflags are
*not* shared.
