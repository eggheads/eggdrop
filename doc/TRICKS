                               Eggdrop Tricks


  Here are some little tricks that you may or may not know about, which aren't
  documented in other areas.

  - You can rename a built-in command by binding over it. To rename '.status'
    to '.report', you'd do:
      unbind dcc - status *dcc:status
      bind dcc m report *dcc:status

    The first line removes the built-in binding on '.status', and the second
    line binds '.report' to the built-in status function.

  - If you don't want your logfiles to be deleted after two days and don't
    want the bot to create a new logfile each new day, then set 'keep-all-logs'
    to 0 and 'switch-logfiles-at' to 2500 in your bot's config file to make it
    keeping one logfile all the time. This is not recommended on high traffic
    channels.

  - You can modify Eggdrop's output in the partyline, kick messages, and other
    texts by editing core.english.lang in the language directory.

  - You can export parts of your config file to separate files. For example,
    if you have several config files which differ from themselves only by
    the nickname and the used servers, you can export them to an own file
    and link it with the 'source' Tcl command, similar to a script. The
    advantage of this is that you have to edit/upload only the small file
    instead of the big one. This technique is also useful if you want to
    maintain the same channel settings, etc across your botnet.

  - You can use variables in your config file, since it's really just a normal
    Tcl file. For example, you can set 'userfile' and 'chanfile' to
    "yourbot.user" and "yourbot.chan" using the following method:

      set myvar "yourbot"
      set userfile "$myvar.user"
      set chanfile "$myvar.chan"
