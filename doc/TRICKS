EGGDROP TRICKS


  Here are some little tricks that you may or may not know about, which
  aren't documented in other areas.

  -   You can rename a built-in command by binding over it. To rename
      '.status' to '.report', you'd do:

          unbind dcc - status *dcc:status
          bind dcc m report *dcc:status

      The first line removes the built-in binding on '.status', and the
      second line binds '.report' to the built-in status function.

  -   If you don't want your logfiles to be deleted after two days and
      don't want the bot to create a new logfile each new day, then set
      'keep-all-logs' to 0 and 'switch-logfiles-at' to 2500 in your
      bot's config file to make it keeping one logfile all the time.
      This is not recommended on high traffic channels.
  -   You can modify Eggdrop's output in the partyline, kick messages,
      and other texts by editing core.english.lang in the language
      directory.
  -   You can export parts of your config file to separate files. For
      example, if you have several config files which differ from
      themselves only by the nickname and the used servers, you can
      export them to an own file and link it with the 'source' Tcl
      command, similar to a script. The advantage of this is that you
      have to edit/upload only the small file instead of the big one.
      This technique is also useful if you want to maintain the same
      channel settings, etc across your botnet.
  -   You can use variables in your config file, since it's really just
      a normal Tcl file. For example, you can set 'userfile' and
      'chanfile' to "yourbot.user" and "yourbot.chan" using the
      following method:

          set myvar "yourbot"
          set userfile "$myvar.user"
          set chanfile "$myvar.chan"
