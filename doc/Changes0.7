Eggdrop Changes (since version 0.6)

    _____________________________________________________________________

0.7d (April 11, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - Msg-command 'who' wasn't looking up info by hostmask, it was using the
    nicknames -- fixed

  - Asking for 'info' via msg when you have none will tell you that now

  TO-DO:

  - Make '.user' match possibly by last join time
  - BUG: can crash (infinite loop) somewhere in file system
  - Actually the file system still needs major improvement (sigh) - it sucks
    -- and it now causes PIPE FAULTS (ugh!!!!)
  - Finish installing tandem-bot support (big job)


0.7c (April 11, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - Tacking on the '[Nick]' in front of an auto-greet is done if the current
    nickname isn't in the greeting, not if the handle isn't in it (oops)

  - Telnet works again (it wasn't initializing a variable... good grief!)

  - New user flag 't' (tandem) for marking users who are actually other bots
    which will be running in tandem (shared user list)

  - Can '+tandem' and '-tandem' on the party line now, but no actual
    difference in behaviour yet

  - Preliminary support for userinfo (autogreets) being stored in the
    userlist instead of a separate file

  - Notes aren't logged any more (was getting annoying)

  - '.info' with one parameter works the same (shows info for a user), but
    with 2 parameters, it now sets info for a user: using user-file field

  - auto-greet uses the userfile now instead of a separate file


0.7b (April 7, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - Doesn't double-send help lines anymore in /msg (ACK!)

  - Automatic console mode for masters on the party line now

  - Help files for dcc chat are prepended with "dcc." now (ie, '.help axe' =
    "dcc.axe")

  - All dcc help files external now

  - Can use 'jump' with a parameter: of the form "irc.edu" or "irc.edu 6665"
    and it will move to that server directly -- if it's not in the internal
    server list, it will add it

  - Should ignore incoming data from a nonexistent port (i hope)


0.7a (April 7, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - File system will ignore leading '.' in commands now

  - '?' == 'help' in file system and party line now

  - If it can't find a '.files' in a dcc directory, it will create one when
    a file is uploaded or imported, etc

  - Will create infofile if it's defined and can't find it

  - '.match' will count the number of matches now

  - If the first line of a helpfile is '!op', it will only be shown to
    people with op status

  - If the first line of a helpfile is '!master', it will only be shown to
    people with master status

  - An unknown help query on the party line will check the help directory
    now

  - Valis reinstated.


0.7 (April 7, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - Non-command msgs from ops and masters used to not get into the log --
    fixed

  - Configfile: 'helpbot' = name of helpbot, if applicable

  - Radically changed internal server list movement... now keeps new
    pointers, one for the bot, and one for the helpbot

  - Helpbot is now logged in and changes servers on reconnect so far

  - If the nickname isn't in the join info for a user when they join, it's
    tacked on to the beginning: "[Robey] 20" instead of "20" which is
    confusing

  - dcc info taken out of '.status' and moved to '.dccstat'

  - Helpbot info shown in '.status' now

  - '.set' (aka configfile-set) modes shown in '.status' now

  - If the bot is alone on a channel and doesn't have ops, it will leave and
    rejoin to gain ops

  - Won't send out the gain-ops string if it joins a channel and gets auto
    ops for creating the channel (was a bug)

  - Not setting 'dcc-path' actually disables dcc (was a bug)

  - '.channel' doesn't show boring ban stats any more (use '.channelbans')

  - Doing a channel reset shouldn't make people appear randomly split
    anymore

  - Helpbot changes nicks now if the default nick is in use

  - 'who' msg queries are done via the helpbot if available

  - Response to a new-user 'hello' is done via helpbot if available

  - 'hello' tells the new user about the 'who' command

  - Most configfile settings can't overflow their internal space now

  - Removed dysfunctional configfile 'do' command

  - dcc flooding should be thwarted now (more than 7 msgs in 1 second)

  - New configfile setting: 'helpdir', which is the directory the help files
    are stored in -- if not defined, the standard one line responses are
    used -- otherwise, the file "help" is shown for default help, and all
    other help requests are displayed only if there is a corresponding file
    in the directory (error message ortherwise)

  - Default help responses are done through the helpbot if available

  - Status of message queue (and helpbot msg queue) displayed in '.status'

  - If learn-users is on, and a help request is received from someone the
    bot doesn't know, it will suggest they try 'hello'

  - (end of Valis, which was still running 0.6r)

  - dcc flood limit set to 3 (was 7)

  - Can send notes to 'HQ' now (hq = terminal console)

  - msg queues empty 1 msg per 2 seconds now, in sync with server flood
    control
