Seen Module
===========

This module provides very basic seen commands via msg, on channel or via dcc.
This module works only for users in the bot's userlist. If you are looking
for a better and more advanced seen module, try the gseen module by G'Quann.
You can find it at https://www.kreativrauschen.com/gseen.mod/ and
https://github.com/michaelortmann/gseen.mod.

This module requires: none

Put this line into your Eggdrop configuration file to load the seen module::

  loadmodule seen
