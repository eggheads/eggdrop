Patching Eggdrop
================

Eggdrop is an open source project that depends on contributions of its users- like you! If you come across a feature you'd like to see implemented, find a bug, or think the documentation could be made more clear, you can open an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/eggheads/eggdrop/issues>`_ to discuss your ideas, and then submit a `Pull Request <https://github.com/eggheads/eggdrop/pulls>`_ to implement it!

Submitting a patch via GitHub
------------------------------------------

To create a patch via github:

  1. Fork the eggdrop git repo by logging in to your GitHub account and
     clicking the fork button at the top of the screen. Follow the 
     directions it provides to configure your local repo.

  2. Enter the local directory and create a new branch for your patch::

       git checkout -b <DescriptiveBranchName>

  3. Make your changes

  4. Once you confirm your patch works, push the changes back to your 
     GitHub repo - this is usually done by something similar to::

       git push origin <DescriptiveBranchName>
  
  5. Create a pull request by clicking on the "Pull Request" button on 
     your GitHub page. Select the appropriate branches (usually eggheads/eggdrop/develop
     and yourUserName/eggdrop/YourBranchName)

  6. Fill in the Pull Request template and submit

  7. Pour yourself a cold one and bask in the warm feeling of contributing
     to the open source community! Karma++!
