Eggdrop Changes (since version 0.9)

    _____________________________________________________________________


1.0t  (June 8, 1998):

  # Released by: KingKurly <kurly@mindless.com>

  - Added 'make install' to the 1.0 series. You can still use putegg if you
    insist, but make install is just too cool to pass up.

  - Fixed a few annoying little warnings at compile time. Doesn't change
    functionality at all. How exciting.

  - Fixed a spelling error or two in the config. Now this is PROOF that I'm
    bored.

  - If you already run a happy 1.0p fully patched, or a 1.0s, this is really
    an unneeded version. I only put it together in boredom. Note how the
    last two versions I put out were also products of the summer boredom.


1.0s (July 14, 1997):

  # Released by: KingKurly <kurly@mindless.com>

  - Directory/file structure more like 1.1.x.

  - More tcl scripts loaded by default.


1.0r (July 13, 1997):

  # Released by: KingKurly <kurly@mindless.com>
    [not public, unreleased due to unplugged security hole]

  - Fixed a small compilation time warning from main.c


1.0q (June 1997):

  # Released by: KingKurly <kurly@mindless.com>
    [not public, internal testing] (basically just 1.0p+dk+pl6)

  - Added info to README and botchk on how to setup a cron without receiving
    emails from cron.

  - Added check for a userfile in botchk. Move the ~new or ~bak file over
    if one doesn't exist.

  - Fixed flag bindings for help files.

  - Added console wallops to log wallops sent to bot. Also added user def'd
    log levels 6-8.

  - Updated nets.list for RussianNet and The-Net.

  - Added action.fix.tcl to the standard tcl scripts.

  - Added tcl command topic that returns the topic of the channel given to
    it. Also .topic without arguments returns the console channel's topic.

  - Fixed nulluser from being shared out.

  - Added define for the default irc port to connect to in eggdrop.h

  - Fixed revenge bug of "Banning so and so now..." not setting a ban.

  - Made +ban be able to set channel specific bans. Also -ban <hostmask>
    will remove matching channel bans.

  - Made it so only owners can change a shared bot's password.

  - New telnet users can't use the bot's name as a username.

  - Ported beldin's NEWLINKS code from 1.1

  - Made .nick be able to be used by any partyline users

  - Added feature that bot msgs users on channel and partyline that they
    have notes every hour. The time after the hour is set in the config file
    with set notify-users-at.

  - Added an extra * in front of the username in maskhost in case of users
    not running ident.

  - msg_ident returns if person tries to ident with bot's name. Could be
    used for detection.

  - msg_op requires a password to be set in order to op a user. Also,
    msg_op can take a channel as an argument and only op the user in that
    channel instead of all the channels.

  - Fixed bug in tputs with logging an invalid socket.

  - Added setting timezone in config for scripting purposes to keep track of
    the bots timezone.

  - Added tcl command resetchan from julius+bel1.

  - Expanded tcl command dcclist to include bots, files receiving, files
    sending, and files send pending.

  - Fixed memory leak in userrec.c

  - Allowed channels with 8-bit characters in channels.

  - Undoes the fix in dk+pl4 for the broken file system.

  - Includes the corrected patch by poptix to change users going to the file
    system from parting to just being away. Fixes .whom bug.

  - Fix in altnick suggested by Wild

  - .whom bug fix for users going to a broken file system

  - Fix for notes coming in from 1.1 Eggies

  - Implementation of -user -host and chattr on shared bots for bot entries,
    but will not affect bots marked +s.

  - Added share-greet to config file. 0 means do not send out info
    change to shared bots, 1 do.

  - Fix for the telnet (dropping a relay) bug reported by DK.

  - Changes the structure of the "special" character handling code in the
    dcc_chat function in dcc.c to a for loop instead of a while loop.

  - Added the code for ESC characters from beldin4e.

  - Updated nets.list

  - Fix for new 1.1 partyline join/part stuff, 1.1 - 1.0 - 1.1 botnets now
    work properly.

    because your nickname is banned, plus some buffer overflow fixes
    Patch by: cmwagner

    whether it is specifically the channel or the nickname, bot will not

  - Space before ctcp commands would be stripped off, could be used to
    detect eggdrop bots
    Patch by: cmwagner

  - When rehashing and the bot was using the alternate nickname it would

      get/set a dir's required flags

    Reported by: Rajat Goel
  - Changing nicks every 60 seconds on the undernet (which eggdrop does when

    use ISON to determine if the name is available
    Reported by: Troy Davis
  - killdcc <idx> "on a relay to another bot that was stuck (I had lost the
    connection to my ISP) and the bot went haywire ('Can't find user for
    relay!')"

  - 'kick'/'kickban' won't kick other channel bots

1.0m (December 4, 1996):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <robey@netcom.com>]

  - '.kick' was broken (that's what i get for meddling) (fixed)
    Found by: tuvix

  - Since undernet uses 484 ("restricted connection") to mean "you can't
    kick or deop the channel server", bots that attempted to do this would
    think they were i-lined (a concept that does not exist on undernet) and
    jump -- now uses umode +r to detect
    Found by: Emmanuel Marty

  - 'banner' could send blank message (fixed)
    Found by: EraseMe

  - 'adduser' existed for limbo bots (fixed)

    Found by: Dejan Oklobdzija

    sharebots from sending a slew of deops all at once, most of the time)

  - dcc transfers will display acked amount in the home stretch

  - ^C not counted as avalanche material any more

  - Euronet 437 (nick has been juped) now understood and (sort of) treated
    Suggested by: genady

  - Typo on ques3 (fixed)

  - Mode changes by non-ops will be reversed (apparently on some nets, a
    desync makes it appear that non-ops are doing mode changes)
    Suggested by: xerox@foonet.net

  - whom info wouldn't get updated on a Tcl 'setchan' (fixed)
    Patch by: Beldin

  TO-DO:

    locked (fixed)

    Suggested by: Bert Bohla

  - 'die' will wait a little longer for the server to catch up
    Suggested by: Bruce Gingery

    turned off by setting flood-ctcp to 0)
    Found by: edmiester

  - Remote boot was getting logged incorrectly (fixed)
    Found by: Gord-

    (fixed)

    Found by: iceman

    Found by: darkshde

  - Mysteriously vanishing half of a relay could cause infinite loop -- the
    recovery is cleaner now, though still choppy (this should not happen)

    might sometimes fail to recognize itself, and would punish itself for
    nick floods (fixed)
    Found by: Nicholas J. Dear

    scripts that load on startup) were loaded (fixed)

  - Spelling fixes

  - Whom signoff notice was mangled when relaying off the bot (fixed)
    Found by: Gord-

    the bot would obsessively deban once a minute until the server reacted
    (fixed)
    Found by: Bruce S.

  - expire-time for bans and ignores was displayed weird (fixed)

  - When kicked from a channel, queue the join to avoid excess flood
    Found by: xerox@foonet.net

  - Changing nicks on the party line wouldn't update whom info on other bots
    (fixed)
    Found by: Michele

  - First word of ban comment was stripped off in the kick comment (fixed)
    Found by: Gaven Cohen

  - Idle time was always 15 mins for remote users in whom right after a
    connect (fixed)

  - +autoop will make the bot op a user after he/she idents or is .adduser'd
    (if they're +o)
    Suggested by: Jesse Schachter

  - New Tcl command 'whom'
    Suggested by: Gord-

  - Fake connections trapped by net module now (was causing failed connects
    to look like successful connects that got immediately dropped)

  - Debugging console mode

  - Better version handling (patches can identify themselves more easily, to
    the user and to scripts)

  - Wasn't adding hostmasks correctly for bots when they were on the channel
    (fixed)
    Found by: dorgan

  - Access to help files wasn't following chattr changes (fixed)
    Found by: Stephen Hunter

  - People with only +p can now ask for help on specific items

    in the file system was removed (fixed)

  - Filedb will be updated (checked against the actual directory contents)
    if it's been more than 12 hours since the last update, even if the
    directory modification time hasn't changed (some changes in the
    directory, like file-size changes, won't change the directory
    modification time)
    Suggested by: Andrej

  - Bots will pass idle-time hints on connect burst

  - Tcl 'newchanban' wasn't coping with permanent bans correctly (fixed)
    Found by: stephenc

    userfile, version (version can't be changed ever)

    automatically at midnight)
    Suggested by: genady

  - When restructuring botnet to get to a +sh bot, if the direct uplink is
    not +sh, this bot will disconnect from the uplink instead of asking the
    remote +sh to unlink
    Suggested by: Gord-, genady

  - Sharebots will share hostmasks & addresses for bots (and ONLY that info)

  - tbuf status is shown in 'status'

  - weed will expire old bans and ignores if you want it to

  - 'setlaston' will take an optional timestamp argument
    Suggested by: Gord-

    use ISON to determine if the name is available
    Reported by: Troy Davis
  - Some people say their bot thinks it's i-lined when it's not, but i can't
    duplicate it, and those people won't send me logs or info

    teeny little window when it was unprotected

    be run just in case it has a magical oper command or something

    since they don't need the other info displayed
    Suggested by: stomper

  - Made 'configure' look for new-style Tcl library names (ie libtcl75.a)
    Suggested by: Kendrick Vegas

  - New command 'getaddr' to get a bot's address; 'getinfo' on bots will

    used it and it didn't even compile with some 7.5's

  - Checking for stoned servers would sometimes ping servers with their
    wrong name (fixed)
    Found by: tris

  - Various changes to make limbo bots less irc-bound
    Suggestions by: slix

    transfers
    Suggested by: Jordy

  - Flood settings can now specify the time-lapse (# of seconds) which still
    defaults to 60 (probably too high)

    guess

  - Channel-specific bans weren't set when joining or re-checking bans

    (fixed)
    Found by: Fred1

  - Slightly better rejection of unsupported telnet IACs (thanks to ken
    keys)

    people will burn me alive for it i'm sure)

  - Notes are moved along with a handle change now

  - # of notes shown in 'whois' display
    Suggested by: ledpighp

  - Moved notes system into its own module for eventual cleanup (yeah right)

  - Won't block on DNS searches more than 10 seconds

    telnet IAC code used this, and it only manifested itself as a throw-away
    of any line less than 5 chars that had IAC codes in it (fixed)

  - More informative debug info written on crash

    unlink (fixed)

1.0g (July 23, 1996):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <robey@netcom.com>]

    Found by: cmwagner

    Found by: tris

  - Several commands would behave strangely with extra spaces added (fixed)
    Patch by: cmwagner

    Patch by: cmwagner

  - Tcl wants fds 0/1/2 left open, but they're redirected to /dev/null now
    so it can't harm anything

  - Most normal mode flushes are queued now to avoid the bot flooding itself
    off when it joins a bunch of channels at once and starts implementing
    bans from the list

  - 'adduser' could add users with nicks > 9 chars (fixed)
    Found by: taz-man

  - Added PRIVATE_OWNER define so that dictatorial sharebot networks can
    have one master bot which ignores any +n modes coming from slave bots
    (all slave bots must therefore have 'owner' set so that when downloading
    the user file, they will at least have some local +n's that don't exist
    on the master)

  - 'invite' didn't recognize net-splits or non-invite channels (fixed)
    Patch by: tris

  - Removed "strong connection" since it was a no-op

  - Userfile marks a version number now, and has upgraded to v2 (will read
    v1 user files but writes only v2 ones)

  - Passwords are encrypted now using blowfish (public domain equivalent of
    DES without silly patent laws or government interference)

  - Rudimentary socks firewall support (outbound connections only so far)

  - Repetitive ban checking used wrong timestamp (fixed)

  - Wasn't really switching between m/h queues when dumping to server

    doesn't know the user
    Suggested by: jonte

  - Joins & parts of botnet users is shared now, to eventually replace
    '.whom' in a few versions

  - '.chinfo' pretended to change info of non-existent users (fixed)
    Found by: Aaron Zollman

  - Support for sun firewalls (as much as there can be) -- will barely work,
    if at all, since "telnet passthru" wasn't meant for machine use

  - Entering anything but "*bye*" on a relay attempt that hadn't connected
    yet would crash the bot (fixed)
    Found by: tris

  - Entering "*bye*" on a relay attempt that hadn't connected yet would fail
    to announce that the user had rejoined the party line (fixed)

  - PRIVATE_OWNER define wasn't actually working (fixed)
    Found by: Gord-

  - Updated 'weed' for new userfile format

  TO-DO:

      move/copy a file
      make/remove a dir
      get/set a dir's required flags
  - '.sort' to sort files

  BUGS:

  - None (HA!)
  - Some complaints that a large filedb file gets created (fixed? maybe?):
    + Fred1 says it happens in /gifs/abpem, suggesting that the removal/
      addition of directories might be a culprit
  - Channel bans aren't saved in the userfile, or downloaded to other bots:
    they probably should be.

    any char below 32 except ^B, ^V, ^_

  - Bots aren't penalized for bogus channel keys or bans

  - bitch/protectops combo wasn't working quite right on deop yet (fixed):

    Found by: brenny

  - Can define 'altnick' now to avoid blatantly obvious "Lamebot0" nicks
    Suggested by: cmwagner

    trying to join various servers and channels
    Found by: dannyboy

  - Measures and displays server lag in '.status'

  - Added separate flood threshold 'flood-ctcp' for CTCP floods

  - Super-long CTCP ECHO/PING/ERRMSG requests are just ignored

  - strong-connect sockets were losing incoming data at the beginning of the
    connection (fixed)

  - Directory wasn't closed after filedb-update (fixed) (maybe this caused
    the explosive filedb's?)

  - No longer dumps out existing chat-channel assoc's to new bots when they
    link (caused stupid floods, etc)

  - Could possibly flood itself off with channel joins when starting up
    (fixed)

1.0e (Jul 2, 1996):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <robey@netcom.com>]

    ban was being placed ("after" the ban was placed, from the bot's point
    of view) (fixed)
    Found by: Fred1

  - Stupid new '+', '-', '^', '=' preceding usernames are stripped unless
    strict-host is on

  - Added 'pushmode' and 'flushmode' Tcl commands

  - Buffer overrun on check_chanlist()
    Fixed by: cmwagner

  - filedb-path wasn't working (fixed)

  - If the bot cycles a channel, becomes the only member, and still isn't
    op'd, it will assume it's i-lined and jump

  - Failed dcc chat was pressing on with assumed successful connect (fixed)

  - Identity change (changing the bot's nick and then reloading the config
    file) would wait a while before changing nicks on the server (fixed)
    Found by: Laurens v. Alphen

  - Colorization (^B/^V/^_) in bans was considered bogus (fixed)
    Found by: topcat

  - Don't re-op someone if they are not +o and bitch is on, even if protect-

    Found by: seadawg

  - Relay uses "strong" connections to try not to be fooled by async i/o

  - Failed relay attempt would cause crash (fixed)

  - Bogus IAC packets in telnet connections could cause endless loop (fixed)
    Exploited by: "eggcrash"

      addition of directories might be a culprit
  - Aborting a userfile transfer is usually fatal now (why?)

    but some could be marked as permanently active)
  - Channel bans aren't passed between sharebots: should they be?
  - Tcl commands for:
      move/copy a file
      make/remove a dir
      get/set a dir's required flags
  - '.sort' to sort files
  - Be able to clear all bans
    Suggested by: blackjac

  BUGS:

  - None (HA!)
  - Tcl 'sign' bindings sometimes crash (?)
  - osf/1 has dns problems -- no known solution (might be unsigned long
    problem?)
  - Some complaints that a large filedb file gets created (can't duplicate,
    might be just a rumor)
