(1) ABOUT EGGDROP

    Eggdrop was created around December 1993 to help stop the incessant
    wars on #gayteen.  It spawned from another bot I had been writing
    at the time called "Unrest".  The purpose of Unrest was to answer
    help requests from other bots (the equivalent of eggdrop's current
    helpbot option).  The first public release was (I think) v0.6, and
    it's grown a lot since then.

    To use eggdrop, you need:
    * some sort of Unix account -- it does not compile for Windows or
      Mac machines, nor will it probably ever compile there
    * pretty good knowledge of IRC and Unix, including how to compile
      programs and what DCC chat is, at absolute minimum
    * about 500k of disk space, or more, depending on your system (on
      Linux, the executable takes up about 400k currently -- it will
      be a lot larger on a RISC system)
    * the Tcl libraries -- if you don't have them (and most systems
      should), check the README file on info about how to install it
      yourself (you don't need to be root)

    Before starting, ask yourself if you really need a bot.  Most IRC
    servers allow only a handful of bots -- some forbid them outright.
    The reason?  Too many people run bots as "toys" or as a means of
    destruction.  If you want to use eggdrop for destructive purposes,
    go ahead and erase this directory now.  It's almost impossible to
    do what you want with this bot.

    You should try to find at least one server that will allow you to
    run a bot.  If you use an ISP (Internet Service Provider) that runs
    its own IRC server, check to make sure that bots are okay.  If you're
    going to use a server somewhere else, read the MOTD (message of the
    day) and find out what their bot policy is.  Following the rules will
    go a long way toward making your bot accepted.

    Generally speaking, you only need a bot on EFnet if your channel has
    a constant supply of users (24 hours a day) and no bot.  If your
    channel already has a couple of bots on it, it probably doesn't need
    any more.  More bots don't do any more good, and waste bandwidth.
    On the Undernet you will probably never need more than one bot per
    channel.  Also note that it's generally not acceptable to use a bot
    to "keep a channel open" when it's not in use.  However, policies
    differ from net to net and server to server so check around before
    starting.

    Bots CANNOT provide absolute protection.  Nothing can.  Eggdrop will
    try its hardest but there are no guarantees.


(2) STARTING OUT

    Obviously the first thing you want to do is compile the bot.  The
    README file tells you what to do and answers some frequenty-asked
    questions about compiling.  If you're in a rush and you know what
    you're doing, you don't have to read this at all -- the README file
    tells you how to quickly compile and start up the bot.

    If you've read this far, then, I'll assume you have successfully
    compiled eggdrop and edited the config file.

    First of all, eggdrop has some command-line options -- not many,
    because most things should be defined through the config file.
    However sometimes you may want to start up the bot in a different
    mode, and the command-line options let you do that.  Basically,
    the command line for eggdrop is:

    % eggdrop <options> <config-file>

    The options available are:

    -n   Don't background.  Normally eggdrop will move itself into the
         background when you start it up, meaning you'll get another
         shell prompt and you can do other things while the bot is going.
         With -n, you won't return to the shell prompt until the bot
         exits (which won't normally happen until it's killed).  By
         default, -n will send all log entries to the console.

    -nt  Don't background, use terminal.  This is just like -n, except
         that instead of seeing log entries, your console will simulate
         a DCC chat with the bot.

    -nc  Don't background, show channel info.  This is just like -n,
         except that instead of seeing log entries, every 10 seconds
         your screen will clear and you will see the current channel
         status, sort of like "top".

    -m   Create userfile.  If you don't have a userfile, this will make
         eggdrop create one, and give master/owner status to the first
         person that introduces himself or herself to it.  You'll need
         to do this when you first set up your bot, and never again.

    -v   Show version info, then quit.

    Most people never use any of the options except -m, and you only
    need to use that once.

    It's advisable to run your bot from its own directory.  That way
    upgrading to a new version is somewhat painless.  You can put your
    config file and user file in that directory, and then when you
    compile a new version of eggdrop, you just have to do:
       make install DEST=<directory>
    and it will copy eggdrop, modules, scripts, and the help files. Please
    note, that you need to specify an absolute path here, relative paths
    like '../mydir' for example will not copy everything.

    There are three config files shipped with your eggdrop,
    eggdrop.simple.conf, eggdrop.advanced.conf and eggdrop.complete.conf.
    The names of the files already indicate their use, so no need here
    explain this further on. You need to edit that file and change almost
    everything.  It specifies the bot's nickname, server list, and pretty
    much everything else about how your bot will work.  You should also
    rename it from "eggdrop.conf" to something resembling your bot's name,
    for convenience.  I call mine "snow" since my bot is "Snowbot".

    You can execute the script to start the bot.  For example, I use:
       chmod u+x snow
    to make the "snow" script executable.  Then I edited the first line
    of the script to say:
       #!./eggdrop
    which tells the operating system which program to run when executing
    this script.  (Obviously, it needs to run eggdrop.)  If you're too
    lazy to do this, or just don't feel like it, you can still start up
    your bot this way:
       eggdrop <options> <config-file>
    For example:
       eggdrop -nt snow

    After you've edited your config file and set the directories up the
    way you want them, start the bot with the -m option.  That will make
    it create a user file.  As soon as you've started up the bot, you
    need to go to IRC and introduce yourself to the bot.  Typically this
    is done by sending it the /msg "hello", although many people change
    that greeting to something else (read the config file for more info
    about that).

    When started with the -m option, the first person to introduce
    themselves to the bot will become the master/owner.  You want to
    be that person.  Once you are recognized as the owner, you have
    full access to the commands and abilities of the bot.


(3) USER RECORDS

    People on irc are recognized by the bot according to their user@host.
    That is, if I am on irc as:
       *** Robey is robey@hubcap.clemson.edu (i hate milk)
    then eggdrop will identify me according to "robey@hubcap.clemson.edu"
    and not by my nickname.  I can change nicknames at will and it won't
    forget me.

    For convenience, it's useful to have a "handle" which always identifies
    the same person.  Usually the "handle" is just whatever nickname some-
    one was using when the bot first learned them.  The nickname you had
    when you first said "hello" to eggdrop is the handle it will know you
    by, regardless of whatever nickname you may be using at a given time.

    Because of this, only one person can have a given handle on your bot.
    Masters can change it, and anyone with party-line access can change
    their own handle, but it's intended to be something stable -- unlike
    nicknames on irc which are about as stable as jello.

    Eggdrop likes to store a lot of information about each user.  The
    most important thing stored is the list of hostmasks that a user is
    recognized by.  You can add a new hostmask with the /msg "ident"
    command.  Masters can add and remove hostmasks with the party-line
    commands ".adduser", ".+host", and ".-host".

    Other things that are stored include the user's flags (see below),
    the last time he/she was on any channel, an optional comment, an
    email address, their current directory in the file area, an info
    line which can be displayed when they join a channel, and possibly
    even some other things that Tcl scripts store.


(4) ACCESS LEVELS?  NO, FLAGS

    Eggdrop does not have access levels like some bots.  There are no
    meaningless numbers or titles.  Instead, each user has "flags" that
    entitle them to certain priveledges.  Think of a flag as a badge.
    Any user can have any number of flags -- you can have no flags, or
    you can have all of them.  Some flags are good, some are bad.  Each
    flag is identified by a letter.  The standard flags are:

    m  (master)  someone who has access to almost every feature of the
                 bot

    n  (owner)   someone who has absolute control -- you generally only
                 want one or two people to have this flag

    t  (botnet)  someone who has access to all features dealing with the
                 botnet

    x  (xfer)    someone who has access to the file transfer area of the
                 bot (if it exists) and can send and receive files to/from
                 the bot

    j  (janitor) someone who can perform maintanence in the file area of
                 the bot (if it exists) -- like a "master" of the file
                 area

    c  (common)  marks a user who is really just a public irc site from
                 which any number of people can use irc, making the
                 user@host information useless

    p  (party)   someone who has access to the party line

    b  (bot)     marks a user that is really a bot

    u  (unshare) user record is not sent to other bots

    h  (hilite)  use nice bolds & inverse in the help files?

    Also, there are 26 user-defined flags numbered A-Z (capitals).
    Bots can have additional flags which are explained later on.
    The channel flags for the bot are: (these can also be applied
    globally, or on a channel-specific basis)

    o  (op)      someone who can ask for channel op (+o) status on the
                 channel at will

    d  (deop)    someone who is not permitted to ever gain channel op
                 status

    k  (kick)    someone who should be kicked if they ever attempt to
                 join the channel

    f  (friend)  if revenge mode is on, the bot won't take revenge on
                 someone with this flag

    m  (master)  someone who has the ability to add/delete/modify users on
                 the channel

    n  (owner)   someone who owns the channel

    a  (auto-op) automatically op the person when they join the channel
                 even if the channel isnt +autoop

    v  (auto-voice) automatically give this person a voice it they
                 join a +autovoice channel.

    q  (quiet)   do not allow this person to get a voice on a +autovoice
                 channel

    Once again there are 26 user-defined flags numbered A-Z, as channel
    flags.


(5) THE PARTY LINE

    The most important way you will communicate with your bot is through
    the party line.  The party line is accessable via DCC chat or telnet.
    It's pretty much just a miniature lagless irc (see "Botnet" below),
    but it also consists of a console through which you can watch channel
    activity and give commands.

    To enter the party line, just offer a DCC chat to your bot.  It should
    ask for your password if you've set one.  If you haven't set one, be
    sure to do so, so that you can use the /msg "ident" command and other
    goodies that require some sort of security.

    The party line is actually split up into 200,000 "channels".  The
    console is available from each channel, but you can only talk to
    people who are on your current channel (just like irc).  Channel 0
    is the main party line, while others are typically reserved for private
    conversations. Channels 1-99,999 are botnet wide chat channels and any
    user joining that channel anywhere on the botnet will be able to chat
    with you, Channels *0-*99,999 are local bot-only channels, only people
    on the current bot you are on can chat to you on there channels.

    Commands for the console start with a dot (.), similar to the slash (/)
    used for irc.  At any time you can type ".help" to get a list of the
    possible commands.  To find out what a command does, use ".help
    <command>" -- for example, ".help channel".  This documentation won't
    list every command and what it does, because the online help files are
    sufficient, and it's a lot more fun to explore on your own.

    When you're on the party line, anything you type that doesn't start
    with a dot is considered to be broadcast to everyone else, just like
    talking on a channel.  You can change channels with the ".chat"
    command or even leave all channels with ".chat off".


(6) BOTNET

    People starting up an eggdrop bot for the first time are usually confused
    about the "botnet" support -- ie, the ability to link two or more bots
    together and have them merge party lines, and form a sort of miniature
    irc.

    In order to link to other bots, your bot needs to have a telnet port
    defined in the config file.  The default is usually something like 2222
    or 3333, but it's wise to choose something else, especially if a lot of
    other people are using the same machine.  If other eggdrop bots are
    running from that machine, try to pick telnet ports at least 5-10 apart.

    Sometimes you will specify a port, like 3333, but that's not available
    when eggdrop starts up.  On most operating systems, it just means the
    port was in use recently (probably by your bot!) and it hasn't had time
    to reset it yet.  So eggdrop will try 3334, and maybe even 3335, until
    it gets one.  Other bots are aware of this, and when they try to connect,
    if the specified port (3333 in this example) doesn't work, they'll try
    the next few before giving up.  If you have one bot on 3333, and another
    on 3334, they will always be bumping into each other, and other bots
    will get confused.  That's bad.

    When you first connect two bots together, you need to tell each bot about
    the other one.  To do this, use the "+bot" command.  You need to know:

    1) the nickname of the other bot, like 'Lamestbot'
    2) the hostname, like 'maverick.math.uic.edu'
    3) the telnet port it's using, like 2222 or 3454

    The format of the '+bot' command is:
       .+bot <nickname> <hostname>:<port>

    This creates a "bot record" for the bot, in your userfile.  It's kind of
    like a user record, but a little different.  For example, Lamestbot,
    running from connected.com on port 3454, would be:
       .+bot Lamestbot connected.com:3454

    Now to connect the bots, one of you (but not both!) needs to type:
       .link <botname>

    The first time two bots connect, they set a password for each other, so
    that after that, nobody can "fake" a connection between the two.  You
    can reset that password later with the command:
       .chpass <botname>

    The bot record is like a user record except for two things:
    1) If you share userfiles with another bot (see below), only user records
       are shared.  The bot records will stay on this bot only.
    2) There are special flags that can be set for bots, which can't be set
       for users.

    The special flags you can set for bots are:

    h  (hub)        Your bot will try about once a minute to link to a hub
                    bot, until it succeeds.  Once it's linked to one hub,
                    it will no longer try to connect to others.

    a  (alternate)  If no hub bots can be linked, your bot will try to link
                    to one of these instead.  Once one alternate bot is
                    linked, it won't try to connect any others -- although
                    it will still try to link to hub bots.  If a hub bot
                    connects later, any alternate bot could be dropped.

    s  (share)      This means that it's okay for your bot to share users
    p  (passive)    with this bot.  There's a full explanation of this below,
                    in the section called "Userfile Sharing".

    l  (leaf)       If a bot is marked as a leaf, that means you don't want
                    it to link any other bots behind it.  In other words, it
                    can only be connected to the botnet in one place, and no
                    other bots may be connected through it.

    r  (reject)     Any bot that has this flag will not be permitted on the
                    botnet at all, no matter where it connects.  This is
                    equivalent to irc's "Q-line".

    There are also 10 user-defined flags (0-9) avaliable for use with
    bots only.

    These flags can all be changed by the '.botattr' command just like for
    users.  For example:
       .botattr Valis +sh

    There are several chains of connected bots out there.  See the 'nets'
    file for a list of the ones I've heard of...  If the flags above seem
    confusing, don't worry.  Usually the only one you need to worry about
    is the +h flag.  And most botnets have a policy about what flags you
    should set when hooking in, and they'll tell you what to set.


(7) USERFILE SHARING

    One of the more interesting things you can do when you link two bots,
    is to make them share userfiles.  BE CAREFUL before you do this, though!
    When you link, one bot is going to lose its userfile!  (It will be
    overwritten by the other bot's userfile.)

    To do userfile sharing, you have to make sure the share module is
    loaded. Otherwise, your bot will automatically reject all userfile
    share attempts by other bots.  (It's a safety feature.)

    Next you need to decide which bot will be ACTIVE and which will
    be PASSIVE, the ACTIVE bot will send its userfile and overwrite
    the PASSIVE's userfile, so be carefull. Once you've decided, on
    the ACTIVE bot you set the PASSIVE bot +s, to idicate sharing,
    and on the PASSIVE you set the ACTIVE +p to idicate passive sharing,
    the bot will only share passively with 1 bot at once, but can
    share actively with any number of bots.

    Next go through all the channels you want shared between the 2
    bots and make sure they are +shared in the config file, and also
    that each bot has the other bot make +s for each channel,
    e.g. on bot1: .botattr bot2 |+s #channel

    When two sharing bots first connect, they will transfer the userfile.
    After that, when something in the user records changes, the info will
    be passed to the other share bot(s) so that as long as they are linked,
    they will stay in sync.

    If two sharing bots get disconnected, they will start up resync buffers
    for each other.  If they get reconnected within 15 minutes, they can
    resync from the buffers and not have to re-download the userfile.
    ** this may not work reliably ** :(

    You can mark a bot both +s and +a (share user files, but only link
    as an alternate).  This is very odd and should probably only be used
    as a backup when you have a lot of bots sharing to one central hub.
    Only people who really know what they're doing should try marking a
    bot +s and +a.


(8) BANS AND HOW THEY WORK

    I assume that you know how bans work on IRC.  Eggdrop handles them
    in various ways, and this chapter is intended to help clarify how
    bans are treated within the bot.  There are three types of bans:

    * global bans
      These bans will be active on every channel the bot monitors.  Some
      will "expire" after a while (be removed automatically).  Others
      are considered "permanent" and can only be removed by a master.

    * channel-specific bans
      These bans are active only on one channel, and are almost always
      temporary bans that expire after an hour or so (depending on how
      long you've specified in the config file).  Usually they're created
      by the "revenge" mechanism (if active), or by a Tcl script of some
      sort.

    * non-bot bans
      These are bans that were not placed by the bot, and that the bot
      doesn't care about.  They can be removed by anyone on the channel.
      The other two types of bans are generally protected by the bot,
      and have to be removed via the bot.

    The party-line command '.+ban' adds a global ban.  '.kickban' will
    add a channel-specific ban.  '.bans' will list them all, according
    to their category.  Be sure to check out the help pages for those
    commands for more info.


(9) LANGUAGE SUPPORT

    Large parts of what eggdrop outputs have been translated to other
    languages. At the moment we have English, French and German; however,
    English is loaded by default.

    There are three ways to set your preferred language:

    * Set the environment variable EGG_LANG:
      csh/tcsh:
         setenv EGG_LANG <language>
      bash/ksh:
         export EGG_LANG=<language>
      This takes effect right from the beginning.

    * Add 'addlang "<language>"' to the bot's configuration file.
      This takes effect as soon as the command is processed, so you will
      probably want to add it towards the top of you configuration file.

    * Type '.+lang <language>' on the party line.
      This takes effect as soon as the command is processed.

    <language> is either "english", "french", "german" or possibly
    another language file.

    The last added language is the most preferred language, so eggdrop will
    try to find all messages in that language first and then check other
    languages.

    You can add several languages, e.g. english, french and german. If a
    message is not found in german, eggdrop searches for a french version,
    and if that doesn't succeed it falls back to the english message.

    You can remove languages with the '-lang' command on the party line.
    Btw: 'lstat' displays (among other information) the selected languages.


    The default language directory is "./language". If you want to specify
    another directory just set the environment variable EGG_LANGDIR
    apropriately.

    csh/tcsh:
       setenv EGG_LANGDIR <directory>
    bash/ksh:
       export EGG_LANGDIR=<directory>



(Y) BUGS AND BUG REPORTING

    Although we try hard to remove all bugs, there are probably a few bugs
    left in the eggdrop. Sometimes this may even lead to a complete crash
    of the bot and make a restart necessary. Usually, if a crash occurs,
    a file named DEBUG is created in the bots directory, containing valuable
    information for the development team to fix that bug.

    If you encounter a bug or even a crash, please read doc/BUG-REPORT
    and follow the instructions mentioned therein.


(Z) WEIRD MESSAGES THAT GET LOGGED

    (!) timer drift -- spun N minutes

    This is caused by one of several know things..

     (a) Your bot was swapped out of memory for a while, or that
     for some reason the computer stopped letting the bot run.  Once a minute,
     eggdrop does a few maintanance things, including counting down any Tcl
     timers you have going.  If for some reason, several minutes pass without
     eggdrop getting to do this, it logs this message to let you know what
     happened.  It's generally a bad thing, because it means that the system
     your bot is on is very busy, and the bot can hardly keep track of the
     channel very well when it gets swapped out for minutes at a time.

     (b) on some systems (at least Linux), if the dns your bot is using to
     lookup hostnames is broken, and *very* slow in responding (this
     can occur if the dns's uplink doesnt exist) then you will get 4/5
     minute time drifts continuously, not much can be done about this,
     it's an operating system problem :(

     (c) the clock on your machine has just been changed (e.g. it was running
     behind by several minutes and was just corrected)

    (!) killmember(Nickname) -> nonexistant

    We have yet to track this down.  It's a mildly bad thing, though.
    It means the bot just got informed by the server that someone left the
    channel -- but the bot has no record of that person ever being ON the
    channel.

    jwilkinson@mail.utexas.edu had some insight into this one:

       This is not an eggdrop bug, at least not most of the time.  This is
       a bug in all but perhaps the very latest ircd systems.  It's not
       uncommon during netsplits and other joins for the server to lose
       track of killed or collided join notices.  Also, in some servers,
       it is possible to specify non-standard characters, such as carret
       symbols, which get falsely interpreted as capital letters.

       When converted to lowercase, these symbols fail to get processed,
       and joins are not reported, although parts are.

    Cool that I'm not the only one that makes mistakes. :)  And shame on
    the ircd hackers!
