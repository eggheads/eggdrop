0.9s (January 27, 1996):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <robey@acolyte.slip.netcom.com>]

  - Could remote boot the bot owner (fixed)
    Found by: flyin lion

  - If one master on the channel places a ban on another master, the bot
    will not reverse the ban nor auto-kick (just sit and watch the fun)

  - Binds that matched against wildcards were calling the first match then
    quitting, instead if triggering all the binds that matched (fixed)

  - Spoofed eggnet commands are no longer allowed

  - New Tcl command 'gethosts'

  - Improved method of displaying long outputs from '.tcl' and stopped it
    from being able to corrupt variables

    major support for that network is planned)

  - Notes from bots to users in reference to failed attempted links, etc,
    were coming in from "bot@bot" instead of "bot" (fixed)

    Suggested by: answer

  - Each bind to a single command can keep its own flags now (whew)

  - Made a change in 'home-channel' take effect immediately

    Found by: Rich

    Found by: answer

  - msg commands from the bot to itself are now ignored

  - 'topc' bindings are triggered when joining the channel and there is no
    topic set (sends "" to the proc)

  - Does not complain to the user any more when removing a user-placed ban
    while forbid-bans is on
    Suggested by: Keith Tyler

  - Userlist is always stored in the original order now instead of reversing

  - Tcl 'botname' wasn't getting set until it joined a channel (fixed)
    Found by: seljo

    Suggested by: seljo

  - After much work and prototype adding, it compiles cleanly with '-Wall'
    for me (using Tcl)

0.9q (November 10, 1995):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <robey@lightning.net>]

    in the file list (fixed)

  - Flag 't' changed to 'b' to make it more intuitive (bot flag)

  - Two new user-defined flags: '6' & '7' (flag6, flag7) for Tcl

  - New bot flag 'h' -- a bot with the 'h' flag is only auto-connected if
    there are no other bots connected that also have the 'h' flag (ie, you
    can have several bots marked +ah, and once one is connected, none of the
    others will be auto-connected)

  - Trying to change a user-defined flag to an invalid character will now
    immediately fail (instead of reverting later) -- the return value for
    the 'set' command will be the old value if the new one was rejected

  - The 'idx' parameter sent to controlling functions (using Tcl 'control')
    was incorrect (fixed)
    Found by: seljo

  - If an error occurs in your Tcl config file, it will now log (and dump to

    'putxferlog', 'save'

  - The 'forbid-bans' options wasn't working on non-Tcl bots (fixed)

  - Easier editing of directory headers
  - Send op request to the channel bots via msg, one bot at a time
  - Ask tandem-linked bots for invite
  - Binding for file upload, file download, joining the party line

0.9p (October 12, 1995):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <robey@lightning.net>]

  - Local users can see who's in the file area with '.who'

  - Was interpreting telnet codes via relay (fixed)

    Suggested by: sloot

    Found by: Mikael

  - File area 'pending' now shows file transfers that are currently active,
    and 'cancel' will let you abort them

  - '.edit' was crashing on an empty file (fixed)
    Found by: ragtop

  - '.match' was sometimes claiming to have only 1 match (fixed)
    Found by: ragtop

  - Created dcc commands '.info' and '.email' to let party line users change
    their own info and email address
    Suggested by: softlord

  - Removed '.-info' command and added '.chinfo' and '.chemail' for masters
    to change the email address and info of users (this now conforms to the
    way the rest of the bot works)

  - '.chpass' wasn't checking to make sure the password wasn't too long
    (fixed)
    Found by: Fred1

  - Jumping to a specific server would sometimes cause the bot to give up
    pre- maturely (fixed)

  - Compile-time option to use slower pings on the botnet
    Suggested by: Fred1

  - New config-file setting 'keep-nick' which will allow you to turn off the
    bot's wish to always keep the same nickname

  - New command 'echo' lets you turn on or off the echoing of your own
    chatter on the party line (default is on)

  - No longer says "no access" on a failed dcc chat -- has cuter phrases

  - Logfile modes can be edited, and changing a logfile to no modes will
    make the bot stop logging there at all
    Suggested by: bill

    now (but still before updating the laston time)

  - Logging of kicked bot was garbled (fixed)
    Found by: Fred1

  - Sets last-on date/time to current date/time when a user does 'hello'
    Suggested by: sloot

  - Checks every 5 minutes to make sure the server hasn't zoned out; if it
    has, the bot will automatically jump

  - Think i fixed the net.c crash bug

  - New Tcl 'idx2hand' and 'hand2idx' to make conversions easier

  - New 'configure' script which should make compilation easier for most
    people

  - Tried to make code more portable and standardize the locations of
    function prototypes

  - Moved to outdated "USER username hostname servername :userinfo" format
    because some grumpy servers are trying to detect bots that way

  - New method of including "tcl.h" to fix some systems where the default
    path contains a broken copy of the file

  - Added Tcl bindings 'ctcp' (ctcp in message) and 'ctcr' (ctcp in notice)

  - '+user' and '+bot' were letting you use handles that were too long
    (fixed)
    Found by: poseidon

  - Writes out an 'eggdrop.pid' file now, which is used by botchk
    Patch by: thembones / Script patch by: bill

  - Fixed bug in match.c that made it mess up for ircII (eggdrop usage was
    fine, though, so unless you were using match.c to speed up your ircII,
    you won't notice any difference)
    Patch by: Fred1

  - OSF/1 compile errors (fixed)
    Patch by: thembones

  - '.bots' was overflowing on super-large botnets (fixed)
    Found by: chaos

  - Tcl 'dccsend' will queue a file now if there are too many current xfers
    to the user

  - Notes limited to 450 characters so the bot won't crash

  - Invalid 'nlinked' command thru botnet could crash lots of bots (fixed)
    Found by: wrath

  - 'configure' detects osf/1
    Thanks to: thembones

  - Tcl 'passwdok' wasn't working (fixed)
    Found by: piglet

  - Solaris already has a struct queue, so that had to be changed (grr)

  - Fixes new bans places by users that don't have '!' or '@' now (also bans
    from Tcl scripts)

  - Leading and trailing control characters on parameters to dcc commands
    were getting lost (fixed)
    Found by: troy

  - When fixing bogus bans, it wasn't checking to make sure that its fix
    wasn't just a bunch of wildcards (fixed)
    Found by: jerrold

  - Mass-destination ($*) messages, notices, and ctcps from irc ops are
    logged but not processed

  - 'ident' from unknown person just gets ignored now

  - New variable 'ctcp-userinfo' which allows you to set the response to a
    CTCP USERINFO request

  TO-DO:

  - Make '.match' match possibly by last join time
  - Easier editing of directory headers
  - Send op request to the channel bots via msg, one bot at a time
  - Ask tandem-linked bots for invite
  - Tcl: 'handonchan'
  - Make kick check chanlist and match wildcards

  BUGS:

  - Telnets need '\n\r' while dcc chat requires '\n' ('\r' must be omitted
    or it will be displayed as an inverted M); therefore some telnet clients
    see bizarre linefeeding when connecting to a bot -- not sure how to fix


0.9o (June 8, 1995):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <robey@sin.multiverse.com>]

  - New Tcl command 'control' which lets a Tcl command parse input from a
    dcc user (allowing interactive scripts)

  - idle-kick now exempts +m/+f/+o/+t users

  - Fixed Solaris ucb weirdness
    Thanks to: sandvik

  - Removed all "system" calls except the one in 'exec'

  - New binding 'bot' which intercepts commands coming from other bots

  - New Tcl commands "putbot" and "putallbots" which send commands of the
    type intercepted by the 'bot' binding -- "putbot" sends to an individual
    bot somewhere on the botnet, and "putallbots" broadcasts to all bots

  - Fred1 improved the matching system considerably -- Tcl bindings that use
    wildcards can now also use '%' which will match non-space characters
    (similar to ircII)

  - Master messages (',') on the party line were getting sent to masters
    with chat off (fixed)
    Found by: Xerxes

  - Better checking of which connections should get telnet codes checked

  - Notes sent via msg weren't very private (fixed)

  - File queueing system implemented, to allow 'get *' (etc) to have files
    queued for later transfer, and transfer only 3 or so files at once

  - New file-area commands 'pending' and 'cancel' to list and remove files
    from the queue, respectively

  - When a ban is added, and members of the channel are kicked for matching
    the ban, the kicks are sent out paced instead of immediately -- which
    will make the kicking much slower but will prevent the bot getting
    flooded off, which is more important

  - Avalanche gets you ignored now

  - Revised socket control (mtgets) to not attempt reads on listening
    sockets, since this was causing SVR4 to block
    Found by: shovon

  - Memory manager thought memory was misplaced when it wasn't (fixed)

  - chattr now assumes + if you forget to specify a +/-

  - Tcl wasn't allowing masters to run commands that required flags they
    didn't have (fixed)

  - protect-ops wasn't working (fixed)

  - Was letting people do 'get' with nicknames that were too long to fit in
    the dcc table (fixed)

  - 'simul' wasn't checking dcc types completely (fixed)

  - 'match' command has optional start and limit parameters now

  - Commas in a hostname are masekd out with '?' now
    Found by: ragtop

  - New set 'forbid-bans' which will refuse to let non-masters place bans
    directly on the channel (used to be part of 'bitch')
    Suggested by: eye

  - 'bind nick' and 'bind topc' actually check the flags now (oops)

  - File area 'mkdir' can take an optional parameter now, to set the
    required flags to see/access that directory

  - File area 'import' can take an optional parameter now, to set the
    required flags to see/access any imported directories

  - ESC char is stripped from text on the party line now
    Suggested by: xian

  - Can send notes to multiple users at once now, separating nicks with a
    comma
    Suggested by: Xerxes

  - File area 'desc' will take wildcards now

  - Extended dcc timeout to 5 minutes (from 3)

  - relay wasn't showing the "join" messages correctly when it ended (fixed)

  - dcc transfers were timing out when 2 acks were sent at once (fixed)
    [thanks to fx2 for helping test]
    Thanks to: fx2

  - File descriptions are formatted better when entering now -- will try to
    word-wrap a long description into multiple lines (up to 5) -- can force
    a linebreak with '|' in the description

  - Multi-line comments are copied correctly now during cp and mv

  TO-DO:

  - Make '.match' match possibly by last join time
  - Easier editing of directory headers
  - Send op request to the channel bots via msg, one bot at a time
  - Ask tandem-linked bots for invite
  - Tcl: 'handonchan'
  - Make kick check chanlist and match wildcards

  BUGS:

  - Telnets need '\n\r' while dcc chat requires '\n' ('\r' must be omitted
    or it will be displayed as an inverted M); therefore some telnet clients
    see bizarre linefeeding when connecting to a bot -- not sure how to fix

  - New variable 'dcc-maxsize' which is the largest allowable file size (in
    k)

  TO-DO:

  - Make '.match' match possibly by last join time
  - If user is not on the channel, make 'kickban' do the ban anyway, sending
    a userhost request and banning that
  - Access restrictions on file areas
  - Easier editing of directory headers
  - Store idle time and make it available to Tcl
  - Send op request to the channel bots via msg, one bot at a time
  - Ask tandem-linked bots for invite

  BUGS:

  - Bizarre file problem on SYSV systems, also telnet doesn't work
  - '\n' and '\r' thingy

  - Defining an external editor actually keeps it from compiling the doofy
    editor now (oops!)

  - Started support for NO_IRC mode, where the bot floats in limbo, not on a

    single msg) and, if it was to a channel, kicks the offender
    Suggested by: Fred1

  - New Tcl commands: ctime, myip, dccsend

  - 'whom' can now be used with an argument: 'whom 3' tells you who's on
    channel 3, net-wide; 'whom *' tells you everyone everywhere, but not
    their channel (instead, it marks users who are on the party line)

  - Was barfing on a server list with only one server (fixed)

  - /msg hello wasn't working for common-site users (fixed)

  - Now saves the user file right after getting its first master with the -m
    option
    Suggested by: gavroche

  - When msgQ overflows, it will only log it once until the msgQ drops back
    down to a managable level (then if it overflows again, you'll get
    another log entry)

  - CTCP FINGER and VERSION changed to not give away the fact that it's a
    bot (so nosy ircops won't kill based on CTCP VERSION results)

  - New CTCP EGGDROP added to get true version info

  - Small memory leak when re-away'ing yourself (fixed)

  - Users who match a ban from the permban list can't use "hello"
    Suggested by: gwyn

  - When first starting the bot, won't save the userfile until you actually
    have at least one user

  - New console mode 'b' (for ops and masters) which shows tandem-bot info,
    like links and userfile sharing

  - If the ban list or ignore list comes up in a '.whois' or '.match', it
    won't show the (ugly) user record, but will just say "[ban list] -> use
    '.bans'"

  - Remote '.whom' and '.who' and '.botinfo' aren't logged any more

  - Removed party-line blinding

  - '.die' allows a die comment now, which is logged and broadcast

  - +channels are supported now, but i can't see much point in running a bot
    on a +channel since they don't support modes

  - Tried to fix timer drift problem

  - Various efficiency changes
    Patch by: Fred1

  - '.comment' was pretending to be successful even on nonexistent users
    (fixed)
    Found by: guy

  - Doesn't spend more than 15 seconds trying a server connection now

  - If the bot somehow misses a minute, it will trigger the timer twice (or
    however many times it needs to trigger to catch up)

  - After sending a file, the copy is erased from /tmp now (oops!)

  - Possibly fixed the problem where uploaded files on some systems were not
    being copied into the directory


0.9h (January 12, 1995):

    it will be used as the kick comment

    Found by: clusters

  - Small annoying memory fault when un-awaying yourself (fixed)

  - '.invite' invites someone to the channel now, not the party line

  - Control characters can not be put in an info line any more
    Suggested by: Fred1

  - Notes are no longer erased automatically after you read them
    Suggested by: denali

  - New commands '.notes' and /msg notes to manipulate the stored notes

  - Was giving pointer warning in tcl.c (fixed)

  - /msg whois will now identify masters

  - Sends out the ban faster on join flood now
    Found by: Fred1

  - New reg.c for slightly faster matching
    Submitted by: Fred1

  - Tcl 'dccsimul' & 'putdcc' check for out-of-range and illegal dcc handles

  - Changed resolve_dir() so it might not crash under BSD any more

  - New Tcl command 'timer' which adds a command to the timer queue, to be
    executed N minutes later

  - Two new binding types possible: 'pubm' and 'msgm' which match the whole
    string in a msg or pub (example: bind msgm - "*bot*" msg_bot)

  - Three new Tcl commands: 'unixtime' (returns a long int), 'time' (returns
    something like "14:15"), and 'date' (returns something like "21 Dec
    1994")

  - Finally, '.exec' works again

  - Removed some redundancy in userrec.c

  - Removed the REBOOT option, since it was causing problems -- use a
    crontab entry instead
    Found by: Vassago

  - Was setting the purge flag when changing handles (fixed) -- this
    sometimes caused bot records to be erased

  - Was crashing sometimes when ignores or bans expired (fixed)

  - '.rehash' no longer adds a bogus entry to the server list

  - When manually adding bans (ie '+ban'), if a user gets kicked because of
    the new ban, the ban comment will now be used

    re-arranging their links (fixed)
    Found by: Fred1

  - Doesn't ask for ops if there are no ops on the channel
    Suggested by: gavroche

  - Three new user flags defined (see eggdrop.h)

  - Added the '.chattr' command so you don't have to use '.tcl chattr' any
    more

  - Can't use '@' in a handle any more with '.nick' or '.handle'

  - Doesn't kill your talk/ntalk window if you're in via telnet (aka relay)
    Patch by: Fred1

    Found by: tolim

  - Was putting a space in the log filename in keep-all-logs-mode sometimes
    (fixed)
    Found by: tolim

  - Wasn't trapping notes between users on the same bot when the recipient
    was away (fixed)
    Found by: guy

    still send out an "unlinked" notice to other bots to clear bogus entries
    (ie "???")

  - 'chpass' doesn't log the new password any more
    Suggested by: scipio


0.9g (November 15, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <robey@ulca10.residence.gatech.edu>]

  - Disabled Tcl 'exec' command (possible hole)

  - '.define' no longer exists with Tcl compiled (it's pointless)

  - '.status all' will give a much more detailed list

  - It will tell you if you try to 'ident' from a nonexistent nickname, and
    it already knows you
    Suggested by: kibbles

  - New matching function (10% faster on average)

  - Wrapper function for the string matcher, to catch obvious unmatched
    strings earlier (hopeful speed increase)

  - In msg 'who', should correctly identify itself and fellow share-bots,
    instead of "No info"

  - msg 'whois' will check if the nick specified is not a valid handle, but
    is a nick for someone on the channel, and will try to find a match from
    there

  - '.bans' will no longer show the complete ban list -- it leaves out bans
    which the bot is protecting but are not active on the channel -- new
    command '.bans all' to show the full list (which may be very long)
    Suggested by: Fred1

  - Tcl will auto-add the trailing '/' on paths now (bug fix)

  - Tcl can determine if 'helpbot' config has changed state, and will load
    or kill the helpbot accordingly

  - When compiling with Tcl, the '.set' command is now just a shortcut to
    viewing and assigning any Tcl variable

  - Was losing sockets during dcc file sends (fixed)

  - Wasn't letting you change chanmode properly (fixed)
    Found by: miltrypet

  - Wasn't starting on the first server (fixed)

  - No longer supports external telnet or compiles "eggtel" -- consider it
    an experiment that proved pointless

  - Motd file is filtered through the same filter that the help files go
    through (ie, %-codes are now interpreted there)
    Suggested by: redbird

  - New %-code: %T is current time in a form like "16:35"

  - New set 'upload-to-cd' which, if true, lets users upload to whatever
    directory they happen to be in, in the file area -- in this case, the
    'dcc-incoming' variable is ignored of course
    Suggested and partially coded by: modus operandi

  - Default values for some variables were getting scrambled under Tcl
    (fixed)

  - Uploads and downloads are stored in the temp dir now

  - When copying or moving files in the file area, the "# of downloads"
    field no longer gets reset

  - Uploads and downloads first go to the temp directory, then uploads are
    moved to the destination directory (downloads just sit there till the
    temp dir is cleared)

  - Common-host users can no longer change their info, email, or password
    Found by: sloot

  - Couldn't accurately reverse a mode +l 0 (fixed)
    Found by: miltrypet

  - A variety of the more obvious fake tandembot-codes are detected now, and
    emit warnings

  - Wasn't refreshing a ban quickly enough (fixed)
    Found by: Fred1

  - If user was on the channel in the past 3 minutes, the bot won't re-
    display the user's info-line
    Suggested by: denali

  - No longer interprets a dcc-chat line as a command if it starts with '/'
    (however, '///' will still invoke the talk-script support)

  - Detects and tries to correct a situation where an auto-linked sharebot
    is in the bot-chain, but not directly connected

  - Tandem-bot user records are no longer transferred across share-bot links:
    each bot is responsible for its own tandem-bot list

  - Requests ops from other bots tandem-linked which are on the same channel
    (not via /msg any more)
    Suggested by: Fred1

  - Was showing '@' from info to the channel (fixed)

  - Wasn't checking for too-long nickname in '.handle' (fixed)

  - New command '.nick' which lets ops change their handle on the party line
    -- both commands (nick and handle) will now notify the party line if a
    nick change affects someone on the party line

  - Sends CTCP AWAKE to itself every 5 minutes to keep server from thinking
    it's idle

  TO-DO:

  - Make '.match' match possibly by last join time
  - 'expire' users after a long period of no channel activity
  - If user is not on the channel, make 'kickban' do the ban anyway, sending
    a userhost request and banning that
  - Support gopher-style '.Names' files & converstion to '.files'
  - Rewrite editor
  - file-area directories which are pointers to other bots
  - Send out and keep track of 'attempting' notices for ALL link attempts to
    keep from making duplicate attempts from two different bots
  - Message-storing system via /msg (answering machine)
  - Let people be 'invited' to the party line, and given temporary party
    line access
  - USER_REQPW as outlined by Fred1
  - Allow ops to change the bot's enforced channel mode

  BUGS:

  - Editor is a piece of shit
  - Memory loss, hard to track down
  - Autoban causes bot to crash on some machines(?)
  - When auto-connecting, a bot ought to give up after N failed attempts --
    or else the bot being bothered should stop logging them (or both)
  - Tandem-bot user records are getting lost somehow
  - exec doesn't seem to display correctly


0.9f (October 10, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <robey@ulca10.residence.gatech.edu>]

  - Seems to compile on most linux systems again now

  - Forgot tclhash.c #include (doh!): fixed

  - When using '.jump' with a parameter, sometimes the bot would prematurely
    decide no servers would accept it: fixed
    Found by: vern-n

  - Helpbot always operates in never-give-up mode now

  - Helpbot is pinged once a minute now, and if it gets too lagged (more
    than 60 second response time) or netsplit, the helpbot will be forced to
    jump servers, in order to keep it on the same side of a netsplit

  - Crappy "eggutil" program no longer needed: use "eggdrop -m" to create a
    userfile, and follow the directions (ie, /msg bot hello)

  - Chanmode could have the same setting + and - (like "+i-i"): fixed

  - "you have 3 note37248 waiting" madness fixed

  - Tandem bots were getting deflected to the file area if require-p was
    set, and the bot had op flag too: fixed
    Found by: Jordan, Fred1

  - Some small memory leaks fixed

  - Two new Tcl commands: addhost and delhost

  - Made the auto-connect code a bit better (was sometimes locking onto one
    sharebot, to the exclusion of all else)

  - Special stuff added for suns so it should compile under sunos without
    further modification


0.9e (September 27, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <robey@ulca10.residence.gatech.edu>]

  - New #define in 'eggdrop.h' which will let you compile an eggdrop that
    never gives up on the server list (keeps trying forever if necessary)

  - Errors in the src/Makefile weren't letting Sun compile with Tcl

  - Party line members telnetting in were appearing to be ops: fixed
    Found by: rastam0n

  - log wasn't working in mem.c: fixed

  - Public commands can no longer be truncated (was causing confusion)

  - Binding a command to '#' will remove that binding (if it existed)

  - OS info displayed with 'status' and 'botinfo' will now indicate whether
    Tcl was linked in

  - The command-line arguments to Tcl commands are now passed as a single
    variable (fixes a problem with Tcl interpreting special symbols) -- this
    may require small changes to some scripts

  - New #define HUNT_ZOMBIES in eggdrop.h, in case you have trouble with
    zombies on your system (this should help)

  - Added master command '.banner' to display a message to everyone on the
    party line

  - Tried to make it compile under a larger variety of machines by putting
    some #defines in eggdrop.h

  - Uses more compatible 'sigaction' now instead of sigvec

  - Actually uses TABLESIZE in net.c now (oops!)

  - Uses sigemptyset() instead of setting sigmal mask to 0 (more compatible)

  - Wasn't checking that it had ops before trying to remove channel bans
    with perm-bans off: fixed
    Found by: denali

  - Changed format of '.ignores' to be more consistent
    Suggested by: miltrypet

  - '.handle' wasn't giving any error messages: fixed
    Found by: denali

  - '.chpass' would let you change nonexistent password: fixed
    Found by: denali

  - Added '.topic' command to change the channel's topic

  - New user flag 'common' (c) which marks a common/public irc site -- users
    who match a common record can still introduce themselves to the bot, and
    it will remember them by nick!user@host instead of user@host

  - Wasn't fixing bogus bans correctly: fixed
    Found by: denali

  - When someone joins who matches a ban (enforce-bans is on), bot will
    refresh the ban BEFORE kicking the user
    Suggested by: denali

  - Sometimes was mistaken about what its user@host was: now gets this info
    from the server whenever it joins a channel
    Found by: miltrypet

  - 'exec' hadn't worked in a long time (oops!): fixed
    Found by: miltrypet

  - Notices weren't showing up correctly: fixed

  - Could '.+ban' without any parameters: fixed
    Found by: miltrypet

  - Finally fixed crash under linux with expired ignores

  - "I am here", etc, in server list was flaky: fixed
    Found by: miltrypet

  - When doing '+op', etc, will now say "Nothing changed." instead of
    "Failed." when an attribute change is pointless
    Suggested by: miltrypet

  - Average hop count now shown in '.bottree'

  - A LOT of stuff added for Tcl support -- see the README file


0.9c (August 17, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <robey@ulca10.residence.gatech.edu>]

  - When dying, tells people on the party line (local and remote)

  - Used to crash when receiving bogus 'reject' notices: fixed

  - Optional 'exec-telnet' can be defined now to let you use eggtel, a small
    utility for making dcc chat connections

  - '.kick' had become "ambiguous" in 9b: fixed

  - Besides checking once a minute, it now checks whenever someone leaves,
    signs off, netsplits, or is kicked off the channel -- to see if the bot
    is the only one on the channel (and if so, and the bot is not op'd, it
    will leave and rejoin)

  - '+user' and '+bot' would crash the bot if used incorrectly: fixed
    Found by: miltrypet

  - When finding a bot to autolink, a bot marked as 'share' will take
    precedence now

  - 'away' wasn't re-announcing you (bug from 9b)
    Found by: miltrypet

  - New set 'perm-bans' which, if set off, will make all bans expire after
    10 minutes (permbans will still be stored by the bot, however; and if a
    user joins who matches a permban, she will be kicked off, and the ban
    will be reinstated for 10 minutes)
    Suggested by: miltrypet

  - When connected successfully to another bot, it will kill any pending
    forked processes that are trying to link to that bot

  - Bots send 'trying' notices to each other to notify about link attempts
    (currently these notices are ignored)
    Suggested by: trey

  - OS info shown in 'status', 'botinfo' and 'who' now

  - Tandem incoming connections are now refused from bots already connected

  - Auto-kicks users who join with bogus usernames (control characters in
    the nick!user@host)
    Suggested by: Fred1

  - Should compile for AIX now
    [thanks to trey for providing the account to test this on]
    Thanks to: trey

  - Userfile is written on HUP/TERM signals and during the '.die' command --
    if periodic save is on
    Suggested by: axel_v

  - Wasn't correctly removing bans against op-listed people on the channel:
    fixed
    Found by: lasher-

  - 'you have # notes waiting' message is more clear about what bot to
    connect to

  - No more confusing msgs like "[TexSrv] Hi Robey!  I'm Slurpee..."

  - Put a bunch of context markers in unprog-ban to track down a rare segv
    crash under linux when ignores expire

  - New defines: 'ban-time' (# minutes an automatic ban lasts) and
    'ignore-time' (# minutes an auto ignore lasts) -- 'ban-time' is also how
    long channel bans will last with 'set perm-bans off'
    Suggested by: miltrypet

  - Won't kick itself for removing a bogus ban any more
    Found by: Fred1

  - Error reported if we get a SIGCHLD signal and there are no children
    waiting

  - 'sharing' notices passed between tandem-bots to alert them to make sure
    new passwords match

  - Won't flood check itself anymore
    Found by: Fred1

  - Might have fixed a bug with autoconnecting clonebots

  - When a sharing bot changes its password, bot will change the password
    for a record for itself too (this is confusing, but necessary) (ie, if
    vasha and valis are sharing, and vasha says "my new password is gyx" --
    valis will change the password to "gyx" for vasha AND valis (assuming
    valis has a user record for itself, which it should if it's sharing)

  - Wasn't showing directories with raw-files on: fixed
    Found by: gwyn

  - Clonebot bans were getting automatically expired immediately: fixed
    Found by: ClearlyJa

  - Sometimes the bot wasn't recognizing a banned user when she joined:
    fixed

  - Could infinitely try same failing tandembot connection forever nonstop:
    fixed


0.9b (August 3, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - (happy birthday to me!) ;)

  - No longer wipes dcc records in child processes (was causing rare crashes
    when a dcc chat or likewise failed)

  - Split up dcc.c (was too big)

  - flood-msg setting used to determine dcc chat flooding now

  - 'rm <dir>' was going crazy: fixed
    Found by: denali

  - Superfluous handle changes were being sent between clone bots: fixed
    Found by: trey

  - Child processes aren't caught instantly any more, they're marked and
    finished up a few microseconds later when the bot is ready (was making a
    lot of important data volatile and causing odd crashes)

  - New command '.botinfo' and corresponding tandem notice 'info?' which
    will return the first two lines of the '.who' response from each bot
    linked in
    Suggested by: trey

  - 'whom' was showing up in the log for isolated bots, even when not
    responding: fixed

  - Could remove your away multiple times: fixed

  - Sending an action wouldn't remove your away: fixed

  - No longer sends 'killuser' for removing bans or ignores
    Found by: trey

  - Would crash when resetting bans more than 20 characters long: fixed
    Found by: Fred1

  - Will detect bogus bans (+b and -b) now and kick the offender

  - Wasn't correctly detecting a server-made (fake) op with the new mode
    code: fixed
    Found by: Fred1

  - Will only try one auto-connect at a time, and will check for new auto-
    connect attempts every time a successful link is made (should alleviate
    duplicate connection problems)
    Suggested by: trey


0.9a (July 26, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - Third-party dcc gets ('get <file> <nick>') were claiming to send to the
    wrong person: fixed

  - '.deop' works again
    Found by: neuro

  - New set 'raw-files' which bypasses the use of the file catalog
    ('.files') and just directly reads the directories (useful for making
    your dcc dir point to a pre-existing file library)
    Suggested by: trey, gwyn

  - Can have multiple server entries that are identical now (if you only
    want your bot to connect to one server, put that server in the list 5-6
    times)
    Suggested by: denali

  - Can set your email address via msg now (msg 'email')
    Suggested by: neuro

  - Email address shows up in msg 'whois'

  - Could change someone's handle using '.handle' to a pre-existing handle:
    fixed

  - Three-way userfile sharing wasn't properly propagating info: fixed

  - '-party' didn't work: fixed

  - Wasn't sending out help if helpbot was undefined: fixed
    Found by: gwyn

  - Does a close and shutdown on dcc sockets when closing them

  - '.console' echos back what you typed

  - Wasn't closing sockets on expired forks: fixed

  - New bot attribute 'reject' (r) which will reject that bot if it appears
    anywhere on the botnet

  - '.boot' can have a comment


0.9 (July 23, 1994):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <rpointe@eng.clemson.edu>]

  - File section compiles under sunos again now

  - Bot would crash if a server changed channel mode to +i -- fixed

  - Automatically sends out a 'trace' for each 'linked' now, in order to
    have all the data needed to eventually display a bot tree on demand

  - Once each 5 minutes, a "pong" is sent out to the server to make sure the
    socket is still alive

  - Pipe error now tries to recover by checking fcntl, just like is done on
    a select error (since the select error bit seems to work well)

  - notify-newusers can have multiple targets now, separated by commas

  - "/msg pass" works by your hostmask instead of nickname

  - msg commands now logged as: (nick!user@host) !handle! command...

  - Bots trying to connect with a bad password get "badpass" so they'll know
    what's going on

  - "/msg whois" will tell you if the user is a bot

  - Doesn't send out "newuser" notices for *ban or *ignore

  - Slightly more sanity checking of user records when loading them (will
    try to ignore corrupt & duplicate user records instead of crashing)

  - '.kickban', '.op', '.deop', '.kick' won't try unless the bot is a chanop

  - New 'set' variable: 'keep-all-logs' -- if on, old logfiles will be
    renamed to "<logfile>.<date>" instead of "<logfile>.yesterday" and no
    logfiles will EVER be erased, no matter how old they are (otherwise,
    logfiles older than one day old are erased)

  - '+xfer'/'-xfer' will have immediate effect on people on the party line
    now

  - msg commands are hashed now and referenced via a table (see hash.h)

  - Put '+kick'/'-kick' back in

  - 'jump' more effective now (closes connection manually after 1 second)

  - dcc commands are hashed now (see hash.h again)

  - away status shown in 'whom' now

  - Totally different dcc structure internally now...  WHEEE

  - 'whom' will add "[idle]" if a user is over 3 minutes idle

  - Will check environment variable HOSTNAME for a valid hostname

  - Can send ',' master notices from inside the file system now (and receive
    them)

  - Userfile transmit and receives (from and to clonebots) are now done from
    separate buffers for each bot

  - Dumps a process list to the log if a child process' record can't be
    found (for debugging)

  - File area 'get' can be used with wildcards now for multi-send

  - File area 'ls' can take a parameter now to limit the file listing

  - Bans and ignores are passed between clonebots by their active-time now
    instead of their timestamp (keeps timezone differences from screwing
    things up)

  - CPU usage shown in 'status' now

  - Will try to match truncated commands

  - Keeps a buffer for clonebots 15 minutes after they disconnect, and will
    try to resync if the bots reconnect during that time

  - msg 'who' will tack on a line listing all the people on the channel who
    have no info stored

  - File area 'get' and 'ls' can use relative directories now

  - A passive bot will accept a resync request even if it has no resync
    buffer ready

  - In msg 'whois', if the requested user is on the channel (and
    recognized), the bot will say so

  - Stored notes from people on bots were sometimes getting mangled -- fixed

  - Removed set 'open-channel'  (chanmode replaces it)

  - File area 'hide' can use wildcards

  - Non-masters can set the description for files they uploaded

  - Removed '-console' and '+console'

  - 'console' now specifies a set of console flags, not a simple on/off
    switch, and can be used to set other people's console flags via 'console
    <who> <fl>'

  - Configfile definition 'console' is now simply the default for masters

  - Forked processes will expire after 10 minutes

  - Won't attempt to auto-link to a bot if it's already forking out

  - Tandem link A--B--C--D--E; if C/D disconnected, C would remove E's entry
    from the bot table but wouldn't pass on an 'unlinked' notice: fixed

  - USR1 signal updated to use fcntl and new dccstat format

  - New command '.bottree' which shows a little chart of the tandem links

  - New set 'chan-updates' which can turn off the 5-minute display

  - Now passes nextbot info along with the 'linked' notice, in a new
    'nlinked' notice

  - More robust reading of the user file

  - More robust writing of the user file when periodic-save is off

  - Sends out 'thisbot' notice when connecting, so the bots connecting can
    both agree that they are who they wanted (instead of depending on
    host/port as valid identification)

  - File area 'rmdir' will erase the file-catalog (".files") in that
    directory before attempting to remove the directory

  TO-DO:

  - Make '.match' match possibly by last join time
  - 'expire' users after a long period of no channel activity
  - If user is not on the channel, make 'kickban' do the ban anyway, sending
    a userhost request and banning that
  - Support gopher-style '.Names' files & converstion to '.files'
  - Rewrite editor
  - Command extension ability using shell
  - file-area directories which are pointers to other bots
  - Expand eggutil
  - Send out and keep track of 'attempting' notices for ALL link attempts to
    keep from making duplicate attempts from two different bots
  - Add command '.run' to execute external commands
  - Load external commands into a table for now
  - Message-storing system via /msg (answering machine)
  - Let a topic be set, that the bot will keep
  - Let people be 'invited' to the party line, and given temporary party
    line access
  - USER_REQPW as outlined by Fred1

  BUGS:

  - Editor is a piece of shit
  - Spawns zombie processes on some machines and i have NO idea why!
  - Pipe faults galore sometimes... who knows why
  - Expired ignores & bans sometimes make linux crash
