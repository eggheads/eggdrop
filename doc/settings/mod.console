CONSOLE MODULE


This module provides storage of console settings when you exit the bot
or type .store on the partyline.

This module requires: none

Put this line into your Eggdrop configuration file to load the console
module:

    loadmodule console

There are also some variables you can set in your config file:

  set console-autosave 1

      Save users console settings automatically? Otherwise, they have to
      use the .store command.

  set force-channel 0

      If a user doesn't have any console settings saved, which channel
      do you want them automatically put on?

  set info-party 0

      Enable this setting if a user's global info line should be
      displayed when they join a botnet channel.
