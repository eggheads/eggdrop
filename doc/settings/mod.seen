SEEN MODULE


This module provides very basic seen commands via msg, on channel or via
dcc. This module works only for users in the bot's userlist. If you are
looking for a better and more advanced seen module, try the gseen module
by G'Quann. You can find it at
http://www.kreativrauschen.com/gseen.mod/.

This module requires: none

Put this line into your Eggdrop configuration file to load the seen
module:
