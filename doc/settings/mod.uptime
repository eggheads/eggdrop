UPTIME MODULE


This module reports uptime statistics to http://uptime.eggheads.org. Go
look and see what your uptime is! It takes about 9 hours to show up, so
if your bot isn't listed, try again later.

Information sent to the server includes the bot's uptime, botnet-nick,
server, version, and IP address. This information is stored in a
temporary logfile for debugging purposes only. The only publicly
available information will be the bot's botnet-nick, version and uptime.
If you do not wish for this information to be sent, comment out the
'loadmodule uptime' line in your bot's config file.

This module requires: server

Put this line into your Eggdrop configuration file to load the uptime
module:

    loadmodule uptime
