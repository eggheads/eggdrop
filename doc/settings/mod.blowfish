Eggdrop can encrypt your userfile, so users can have secure passwords.
Please note that when you change your encryption method later (i.e.
using other modules like a md5 module), you can't use your current
userfile anymore. Eggdrop will not start without an encryption module.

This module requires: none

Put this line into your Eggdrop configuration file to load the blowfish 
module:

  loadmodule blowfish
