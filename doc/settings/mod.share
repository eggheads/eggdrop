SHARE MODULE


This module provides userfile sharing support between two directly
linked bots.

This module requires: transfer, channels

Put this line into your Eggdrop configuration file to load the share
module:

    loadmodule share

There are also some variables you can set in your config file:

  set allow-resync 0

      When two bots get disconnected, this setting allows them to create
      a resync buffer which saves all changes done to the userfile
      during the disconnect. When they reconnect, they will not have to
      transfer the complete user file, but, instead, just send the
      resync buffer.

  set resync-time 900

      This setting specifies how long to hold another bots resync data
      before flushing it. This is a setting for allow-resync.

  set private-global 0

      When sharing user lists, DON'T ACCEPT global flag changes from
      other bots? NOTE: The bot will still send changes made on the bot,
      it just won't accept any global flag changes from other bots. This
      overrides the private-globals setting (below).

  set private-globals "mnot"

      When sharing user lists, if private-global isn't set, which global
      flag changes from other bots should be ignored?

  set private-user 0

      When sharing user lists, don't accept ANY userfile changes from
      other bots? Paranoid people should use this feature on their hub
      bot. This will force all userlist changes to be made via the hub.

  set override-bots 0

      This setting makes the bot discard its own bot records in favor of
      the ones sent by the hub. NOTE: No passwords or botflags are
      shared, only ports and address are added to sharing procedure.
      This only works with hubs that are v1.5.1 or higher.
