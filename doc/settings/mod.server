SERVER MODULE


This module provides the core server support. You have to load this if
you want your bot to come on IRC. Not loading this is equivalent to the
old NO_IRC define.

This module requires: none

Put this line into your Eggdrop configuration file to load the server
module:

    loadmodule server

There are also some variables you can set in your config file:

  set net-type 0

      What is your network?

  set nick "LamestBot"

      Set the nick the bot uses on IRC, and on the botnet unless you
      specify a separate botnet-nick, here.

  set altnick "L?m?stB?t"

      Set the alternative nick which the bot uses on IRC if the nick
      specified by 'set nick' is unavailable. All '?' characters will be
      replaced by random numbers.

  set keep-nick 1

      This setting makes the bot try to get his original nickname back
      if its primary nickname is already in use.

  set realname "/msg LamestBot hello"

      Set here what to display in the real-name field for the bot.

  &nbsp;
      bind evnt - init-server evnt:init_server
      proc evnt:init_server {type} {
        global botnick
        putquick "MODE $botnick +i-ws"
      }

  ... is Tcl scripting that is run immediately after connecting to a
  server.

      set init-server { putquick "MODE $botnick +i-ws" }

  ... is Tcl scripting that is run immediately after connecting to a
  server. It is limited to 120 characters, and is depriciated due to the
  EVNT bind (see doc/tcl-commands.doc).

      set connect-server { putlog "Connecting to server." }

  ... is Tcl scripting that is run immediately before connecting to a
  server. It is limited to 120 characters, and is depriciated due to the
  EVNT bind (see doc/tcl-commands.doc).

      set disconnect-server { putlog "Disconnected from server." }

  ... is a Tcl script that is run immediately after disconnecting from a
  server. It is limited to 120 characters, and is depriciated due to the
  EVNT bind (see doc/tcl-commands.doc).

      set servers {
        you.need.to.change.this:6667
        another.example.com:7000:password
        [2001:db8:618:5c0:263::]:6669:password
        ssl.example.net:+6697
      }

  ... is the bot's server list. The bot will start at the first server
  listed, and cycle through them whenever it gets disconnected. You need
  to change these servers to YOUR network's servers.

    The format is:

        server[:port[:password]]

    Prefix the port with a plus sign to attempt a SSL connection:

        server:+port[:password]

    Both the port and password fields are optional; however, if you want
    to set a password or use SSL you must also set a port. If a port
    isn't specified it will default to your default-port setting.

  set default-port 6667

      Set the default port which should be used if none is specified
      with '.jump' or in 'set servers'.

  set msg-rate 2

      Number of seconds to wait between transmitting queued lines to the
      server. Lower this value at your own risk. ircd is known to start
      flood control at 512 bytes/2 seconds.

  set ssl-verify-servers 0

      Control certificate verification for servers. You can set this by
      adding together the numbers for all exceptions you want to enable.
      By default certificate verification is disabled and all
      certificates are assumed to be valid. The numbers are the
      following:

      The numbers are the following:

          ------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          0             disable verification
          1             enable certificate verification
          2             allow self-signed certificates
          4             don't check peer common or alt names
          8             allow expired certificates
          16            allow certificates which are not valid yet
          32            allow revoked certificates
          ------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  set server-cycle-wait 60

      This setting defines how long Eggdrop should wait before moving
      from one server to another on disconnect. If you set 0 here,
      Eggdrop will not wait at all and will connect instantly. Setting
      this too low could result in your bot being K:Lined.

  set server-timeout 60

      Set here how long Eggdrop should wait for a response when
      connecting to a server before giving up and moving on to next
      server.

  set check-stoned 1

      Set this to 1 if Eggdrop should check for stoned servers? (where
      the server connection has died, but Eggdrop hasn't been notified
      yet).

  set serverror-quit 1

      If you want your bot to exit the server if it receives an ERROR
      message, set this to 1.

  set max-queue-msg 300

      Set here the maximum number of lines to queue to the server. If
      you're going to dump large chunks of text to people over IRC, you
      will probably want to raise this. 300 is fine for most people
      though.

  set quiet-reject 1

      This setting makes the bot squelch the error message when
      rejecting a DCC CHAT, SEND or message command. Normally, Eggdrop
      notifies the user that the command has been rejected because they
      don't have access. Note that sometimes IRC server operators detect
      bots that way.

  set flood-msg 5:60

      Set here how many msgs in how many seconds from one host
      constitutes a flood. If you set this to 0:0, msg flood protection
      will be disabled.

  set flood-ctcp 3:60

      Set here how many ctcps in how many seconds from one host are
      recognized as a flood. Not specifying or using number = 0 will not
      check against ctcp floods.

  set answer-ctcp 3

      Set how many ctcps should be answered at once here.

  set lowercase-ctcp 0

      If you want your bot to answer lower case ctcp requests (non
      rfc-compliant), set this setting to 1. mIRC will do this, most
      other clients will not.

  set trigger-on-ignore 0

      If you want Eggdrop to trigger binds for ignored users, set this
      to 1.

  set exclusive-binds 0

      This setting configures PUBM and MSGM binds to be exclusive of PUB
      and MSG binds. This means if a MSGM bind with the mask "_help_"
      exists and is triggered, any MSG bindings with "help" in their
      mask will not be triggered. Don't enable this unless you know what
      you are doing!

  set double-mode 0

      Allow identical messages in the mode queue?

  set double-server 0

      Allow identical messages in the server queue?

  set double-help 0

      Allow identical messages in the help queue?

  set use-penalties 1 (default on net-type 1)

      This enables Eggdrop's penalty calculation. Every command Eggdrop
      sends to the IRC server raises its penalty points. If Eggdrop
      reaches a server limit, it gets disconnected with "excess flood"
      message. Eggdrop is able to count internal those penalty points,
      too and take measures against excess flooding. Note: it's highly
      advised to turn this on!

  set optimize-kicks 1

      This optimizes the kick queue. It also traces nick changes and
      parts in the channel and changes the kick queue accordingly. There
      are three different options for this setting:

          ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          0             Turn it off.
          1             Optimize the kick queue by summarizing kicks.
          2             Trace nick changes and parts on the channel and change the queue accordingly. For example, bot will not try to kick users who have already parted the channel.
          ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      ATTENTION: Setting 2 is very CPU intensive.

There are additional settings for 'net-type' 5.

  _net-type 5 specific features:_

  Attention: Use this settings _only_ if you set 'net-type' to 5!

    set check-mode-r 1

        This settings defines how umode +r is understood by Eggdrop.
        Some networks use +r to indicate a restricted connection. If
        this is your case, and you want your bot to leave restricted
        servers and jump to the next server on its list, then set it to
        1. Please note, this setting is automatically set to 0 for
        net-type 0/2/3/4, and set to 1 for net-type 1.

    set nick-len 9

        This setting allows you to specify the maximum nick-length
        supported by your network. The default setting is 9. The maximum
        supported length by Eggdrop is 32.
