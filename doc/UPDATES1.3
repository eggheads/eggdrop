Tothwolf  BB        Someone puked write_userfile with unfinished "quick"

          Tothwolf/ implemented a config file option (sort-users) to
              Kirk  determine whether the user wants their userlist to be
                    bubble sorted when they save it
          Tothwolf/ removed the quick parameter to the write_userfile
              Kirk  function and made the fekker just sort the list every
                    save, that is if the user has specified they want to do
                    this in the config file. A simple bubble sort shouldn't
                    consume that much CPU time
