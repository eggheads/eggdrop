  - Fix out-of-bounds read error
    Patch by: thommey, Geo / Found by: Robby

  - Clear channel modes on disconnect
    Patch by: Geo / Found by: thommey

    nuke_server() calls reset_chan_info(), which clears channel modes and
    then re-requests them, which is the point of the function. However,
    because the server connection has already been killed, chan->status
    is set to CHAN_ASKEDBANS and thus doesn't re-request the banlist from
    the server when it finally does rejoin. By setting to clear_chan, the
    list is just cleared and the banlist properly requested from the IRC
    server on join.

    Fixes Tcl-related compilation/linking issues by using the
    tclConfig.sh variables and including -lz if Tcl >= 8.6 and we have no
    tclConfig.sh

  - Fix cygwin windows.h inclusion. Fixes #262, #265, #266
    Patch by: thommey / Found by: creatio, jackal

    Cygwin's windows.h inclusion only works if VOID is not defined, and
    we undefine their openssl defines before including the official
    openssh headers. We need to include windows.h to have FreeConsole()
    to launch eggdrop into the background properly.

  - Reset channel information on disconnect properly.
