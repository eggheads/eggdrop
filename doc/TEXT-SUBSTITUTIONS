These %-variables can be inserted into help files, the banner, the MOTD,
and other text files. There are four variables that can be used to format
text:

 %b   display bold

 %v   display inverse

 %_   display underline

 %f   display flashing via telnet; bold underline via IRC

These variables will be interpreted by Eggdrop and replaced by their
respective values:

 %B   bot's nickname (i.e. "LamestBot")

 %V   current Eggdrop version (i.e. "eggdrop v1.6.20")

 %E   long form of %V (i.e. "Eggdrop v1.6.20 (C) 1997 Robey Pointer (C) 2010 Eggheads Development Team")

 %C   channels the bot is on (i.e. "#lamest, #botnetcentral")

 %A   whatever is set in the config file by 'set admin'

 %n   whatever is set in the config file by 'set network'

 %T   the current time (i.e. "15:00")

 %N   the current user's nickname (i.e. "Robey")

 %U   the current operating system the bot is running on

 %%   a percent sign ("%")

You can also encode messages which can only be read by people
with certain flags:

 %{+m}
 Only masters would see this.
 %{-}

 %{+A}
 Only people with the user flag A see this.
 %{-}

 %{+b}
 This is only displayed to users doing a remote '.motd' from another bot.
 %{-}

 %{+|m}
 Only channel masters would see this.
 %{-}

Other variables:

 %{cols=N}     start splitting output into N columns

 %{cols=N/W}   same as above, but use a screen width of W

 %{end}        end columnated or restricted (i.e. %{+m}) block

 %{center}     center the following text (70 columns)
