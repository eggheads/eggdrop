BUG REPORTS:
=== =======
(i.e. things that are broke, but aren't getting fixed anytime soon)

* Solve to non-working alarm(10) in linux (calls to gethostbyaddr/name()
  have blocked for long periods when bind/named doesn't resolve quickly,
  and the alarm does not interrupt it).
* High-bit characters are being filtered from channel names.   This is
  a fault of the TCL interpreter, and not eggdrop.  The TCL interpreter
  filters the characters when it reads a file for interpreting. Update
  your TCL version 8.1 or higher
* Since version 8.1 TCL support unicode characters, like for example è.
  If those characters are handled in a script as text, you run into
  errors, eggdrop can't handle those at the moment.
