KNOWN PROBLEMS


  Things that are broken, but aren't getting fixed anytime soon:

    -   Non-working alarm(10) in Linux (calls to gethostbyaddr/name()
        have blocked for long periods when bind/named doesn't resolve
        quickly, and the alarm does not interrupt it).

        Note: This should now work if you use the dns module.

    -   High-bit characters are being filtered from channel names. This
        is a fault of the Tcl interpreter, and not Eggdrop. The Tcl
        interpreter filters the characters when it reads a file for
        interpreting. Update your Tcl to version 8.1 or higher.
    -   Version 8.1 of Tcl doesn't support unicode characters. If those
        characters are handled in a script as text, you run into errors.
        Eggdrop can't handle these errors at the moment.
