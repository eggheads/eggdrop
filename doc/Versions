This file lists the release dates for most of the officially released
versions of Eggdrop and notes forks, bug fix patches and maintenance
patches. Some of the older versions are missing from the current archive and
their exact release dates are unknown. If you happen to have a copy of an
old version not in the archive available on ftp://ftp.eggheads.org please
get in contact via #eggdrop on Libera so it can be added.

1.1alpha versions:

  Most of the 1.1 alpha versions were named after former US presidents. The
  1.1 alpha versions prior to 'lincoln' never saw a general release and may
  have never even existed. (The first reference to any 1.1alpha versions
  prior to 'lincoln' is in one of dk's patches.) Many of the later 1.1
  alphas were made available as gzip'd tar archives and patches. Release or
  creation dates that are known are included below.

  The 'a.johnson' name had been used by the lincoln
  +lefty1+lefty2+kin1+beldin1 patchset and was skipped for the next version,
  which Robey released as 'grant'.

  There was a naming scheme deviation after 'grant'. The next version before
  'hayes' was named 'julius'. This note is from the main.c file in 'hayes':

    "For future reference: we deviated from the presidents because this is
    where Robey left mainstream development and we weren't sure whether or
    not to use them :)"

  The name 'octavian' was proposed as the next version after 'julius' but it
  reverted back to US presidents and 'hayes' was used instead. Three more
  presidential names had been proposed after 'hayes' but they were never
  used: 'garfield', 'arthur', and 'cleveland'. After 'hayes' the version
  scheme changed to 1.1.x and the next version number used was 1.1.0.

  'lincoln' was the first readily available alpha version with support for
  channel specific user flags.
