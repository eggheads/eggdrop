                         Bans, Invites, and Exempts


  I assume that you know how bans work on IRC. Eggdrop handles bans, exempts
  and invites in various ways, and this file is intended to help clarify how
  these modes are used within the bot. From here on, 'mode' applies to all
  three modes (bans, exempts, and invites) unless otherwise specified. There
  are three types of modes:

    Global modes   These modes will be active on every channel the bot
                   monitors. Some will "expire" after a while (be removed
                   automatically). Others are considered "permanent" and
                   can only be removed by a master.

    Channel modes  These modes are active only on one channel, and are almost
                   always temporary modes that expire after an hour or so
                   (depending on how long you've specified in the config
                   file). Usually they're created by a Tcl script of some
                   sort.

    Non-bot modes  These are modes that were not placed by the bot. They
                   can be removed by anyone on the channel. The other two
                   types of modes are protected by the bot (unless the
                   channel settings specify otherwise), and have to be
                   removed via the bot.

  Bans can also be either sticky or unsticky:

    Sticky     These modes are usually set by a user using the ".stick"
               command. Modes with this attribute are attempted to be kept
               active on the channel at all times by the bot, even if the
               channel is set to use dynamic modes. Obviously, if the channel
               isn't set to use dynamic modes, this won't have any effect.

    Un-sticky  These modes are the style that Eggdrop sets by default when
               a user uses one of the commands that result in a mode. This
               attribute means that the ban will be removed if using dynamic
               modes after a certain time. If a mode is "sticky" and you wish
               to set it to be "un-sticky", use the ".unstick" command.

  Mode behavior:

    Bans     If the channel is supporting dynamic bans, then the ban is
             set when a user with a matching hostmask joins the channel;
             otherwise, the modes are permanently set. On a channel with
             dynamic bans, the ban expires after 'ban-time' minutes (which
             is specified in the config file).

    Exempts  If the channel is not supporting dynamic exempts, then they
             are set at all times. Otherwise, the exemption is set when a
             ban is placed whose host includes that covered by the exempt.
             The exempt will remain in place for at least 'exempt-time'
             minutes (defined in config file) or until after the
             corresponding ban has been removed, whichever happens last.

    Invites  If the channel does not support dynamic invites, then they
             are set at all times. Otherwise, the invite is set when the
             channel is +i and a user requests an invite into the channel.
             The invite then remains set for 'invite-time' minutes
             (defined in config file) or until the channel goes -i again,
             whichever happens last.
