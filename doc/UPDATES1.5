----------------------------------

1.5.0
Foundby   Fixedby   What....
	  Tothwolf  cleanups in several places, NEWTO1.5 -> NEWS, updated
		    french language files, other small fixes
guppy	  Fabian    minor filesys fixes

Wiktor	  Fabian    block_dns_ipbyhost crashed on illegal hostnames/ips
	  Cybah     Fixed tcl_console getting confused between flags and +chans.
	  Cybah     Userfile functions need to use chan->dname.
	  Cybah     Changed most of the user-side findchan() calls to
		    findchan_by_dname() so the commands can support !chans.
	  Cybah     initial !channel support.
	  G`Quann   optimizes irc command queue and stacks as many commands
		    as possible
	  G`Quann   added user definable channel settings
G`Quann	  G`Quann   block_dns_hostbyip crashed on failed dns lookups
 	  Fabian    The transfer module now supports almost unlimited file
 		    lengths, limited only by the system's max file name length.
 		    In addition, temporary files are created in a more race
 		    safe way.
	  G`Quann   added penalty calculation for all commands sent to the
		    irc server to prevent flooding (IRCnet specific)
	  rtc       reintroduced the text/-dir, renamed telnet-banner to
		    banner, set default config filename to eggdrop.conf,
		    put logfiles to logs/-dir by default
guppy	  Fabian    numerical hostnames are now detected
	  Fabian    outgoing bot links weren't correctly initialised, autolink
		    wasn't detecting active bot links and the dns module was
		    still broken from the last byte order changes
G`Quann	  Fabian    was deleting socket 0 if server connect failed
arthur2	  Fabian    the dcc[].addr is now consistently host byte order and
		    all async dns lookup functions accept host byte order IPs
	  Fabian    added an asynchronous DNS request module which prevents
		    the bot from hanging on dns lookups.
