          G`Quann   optimizes irc command queue and stacks as many commands
                    as possible
          G`Quann   added user definable channel settings
G`Quann   G`Quann   block_dns_hostbyip crashed on failed dns lookups
          Fabian    The transfer module now supports almost unlimited file
                    lengths, limited only by the system's max file name length.
                    In addition, temporary files are created in a more race
                    safe way.
          G`Quann   added penalty calculation for all commands sent to the
                    irc server to prevent flooding (IRCnet specific)
          rtc       reintroduced the text/-dir, renamed telnet-banner to
                    banner, set default config filename to eggdrop.conf,
                    put logfiles to logs/-dir by default
guppy     Fabian    numerical hostnames are now detected
          Fabian    outgoing bot links weren't correctly initialized, autolink
                    wasn't detecting active bot links and the dns module was
                    still broken from the last byte order changes
G`Quann   Fabian    was deleting socket 0 if server connect failed
arthur2   Fabian    the dcc[].addr is now consistently host byte order and
                    all async dns lookup functions accept host byte order IPs
          Fabian    added an asynchronous DNS request module which prevents
                    the bot from hanging on dns lookups.
