                      using `.chanset * +whatever'.

          guppy     removed some useless #define's in tclegg.h, and did 
                      some minor cleanups to egg_strcasecmp and str(n)cmp
SuperS    Fabian    snprintf.h used wrong declaration for non-stdarg systems.
          Fabian    Various places using strcmp should use strcasecmp or

          Fabian    Cleaned up minor debugging messages from dns.c.
Jason     Fabian    Under certain circumstances eggdrop would immediately

                      debugging functions.
Wiktor    Fabian    compress and uncompress functions now check whether the
                      passed filenames are actually real files.  tcl commands

                      debug level. Each "Module loaded:" message also states
                      wether the module has language support. \t is supported
                      in language entries. tcl_language is depreciated.
Phoenix   Fabian    resume support in the transfer module was not compatible
                      with mircs implementation. mirc would also do some silly

Wiktor    Fabian    minor Makefile fixes. minor config.status tweaks.
          Fabian    misc aclocal.m4 changes. misc/modconfig now keeps track of
                      known modules. unknown modules are automatically selected
                      on running `make config' / `make iconfig'. `make
                      new-iconfig' only asks questions about newly added mods.
TheQ      Fabian    increased portability of src/mod/eggautoconf
Lucas     Fabian    renamed aux/ to misc/ to avoid problems on win32
Wiktor    Fabian    module names are now correctly distinguished (e.g. bseen

          Fabian    minor fixes to the filesys module
          Jason     Modified .+host so normal users could use it to add hosts
                      to their own record as they can already use .-host. Only
                      allows hosts that don't match other users.
toot      Fabian    added module `compress' which allows compressed user file
                      sending; based on zlib

          Fabian    configure supports `--disable-mod-MODULE' to disable
                      specific modules and `make reconfig' allows you to select
