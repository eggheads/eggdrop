                    safe way.

                    wasn't detecting active bot links and the dns module was
                    still broken from the last byte order changes
G`Quann	  Fabian    was deleting socket 0 if server connect failed
arthur2	  Fabian    the dcc[].addr is now consistently host byte order and
                    all async dns lookup functions accept host byte order IPs
          Fabian    added an asynchronous DNS request module which prevents
                    the bot from hanging on dns lookups.
