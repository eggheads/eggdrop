Eggdrop Tcl Commands
Last revised: February 14, 2010
    _____________________________________________________________________

                           Eggdrop Tcl Commands


This is an exhaustive list of all the Tcl commands added to Eggdrop. All
of the normal Tcl built-in commands are still there, of course, but you
can also use these to manipulate features of the bot. They are listed
according to category.

This list is accurate for Eggdrop v1.6.21. Scripts written for v1.3/v1.4
series of Eggdrop should probably work with a few minor modifications
depending on the script. Scripts which were written for  v0.9, v1.0, v1.1
or v1.2 will probably not work without modification. Commands which have
been changed in this version of Eggdrop (or are just new commands) are
marked with vertical bars (|) on the left.


*** OUTPUT COMMANDS ***

  putserv <text> [options]
    Description: sends text to the server, like '.dump' (intended for direct
      server commands); output is queued so that the bot won't flood itself
      off the server.
    Options:
      -next:   push messages to the front of the queue
      -normal: no effect
    Returns: nothing
    Module: server

  puthelp <text> [options]
    Description: sends text to the server, like 'putserv', but it uses a
      different queue intended for sending messages to channels or people.

      -next:   push messages to the front of the queue
      -normal: no effect
    Returns: nothing

  channel info <name>
    Returns: a list of info about the specified channel's settings.

    Module: channels

 channame2dname <channel-name>
 chandname2name <channel-dname>
   Description: these two functions are important to correctly support
     !channels. The bot differentiates between channel description names
     (chan dnames) and real channel names (chan names). The chan dnames
     are what you would normally call the channel, such as "!channel". The
     chan names are what the IRC server uses to identify the channel. They
     consist of the chan dname prefixed with an ID; such as "!ABCDEchannel".

     For bot functions like isop, isvoice, etc. you need to know the chan
     dnames. If you communicate with the server, you usually get the chan
     name, though. That's what you need the channame2dname function for.

     If you only have the chan dname and want to directly send raw server
     commands, use the chandname2name command.

     NOTE: For non-!channels, chan dname and chan name are the same.

*** MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS ***

  bind <type> <flags> <keyword/mask> [proc-name]
    Description: You can use the 'bind' command to attach Tcl procedures
      to certain events. flags are the flags the user must have to trigger
      the event (if applicable). proc-name is the name of the Tcl procedure
      to call for this command (see below for the format of the procedure
      call). If the proc-name is omitted, no binding is added. Instead, the
      current binding is returned (if it's stackable, a list of the current
      bindings is returned).
    Returns: name of the command that was added, or (if proc-name was
      omitted), a list of the current bindings for this command
    Module: core

  unbind <type> <flags> <keyword/mask> <proc-name>

      the channel listed. If no logfile is specified, a list of existing
      logfiles will be returned. "*" indicates all channels. You can also
      change the modes and channel of an existing logfile with this command.
      Entering a blank mode and channel ("") makes the bot stop logging there.

      Logfile flags:
        b - information about bot linking and userfile sharing
        c - commands
        d - misc debug information
        h - raw share traffic

*** BIND ***

  You can use the 'bind' command to attach Tcl procedures to certain events.
  For example, you can write a Tcl procedure that gets called every time a
  user says "danger" on the channel.

  Some bind types are marked as "stackable". That means that you can bind
  multiple commands to the same trigger. Normally, for example, a bind such
  as 'bind msg - stop msg:stop' (which makes a msg-command "stop" call the
  Tcl proc "msg:stop") will overwrite any previous binding you had for the
  msg command "stop". With stackable bindings, like 'msgm' for example,
  you can bind the same command to multiple procs. When the bind is triggered,
  ALL of the Tcl procs that are bound to it will be called.

  To remove a bind, use the 'unbind' command. For example, to remove the
  bind for the "stop" msg command, use 'unbind msg - stop msg:stop'.

  (A) BIND TYPES

    The following is a list of bind types and how they work. Below each bind
    type is the format of the bind command, the list of arguments sent to
    the Tcl proc, and an explanation.

    (1)  MSG
         bind msg <flags> <command> <proc>
         procname <nick> <user@host> <handle> <text>

         Description: used for /msg commands. The first word of the user's
           msg is the command, and everything else becomes the text argument.
         Module: server

    (2)  DCC
         bind dcc <flags> <command> <proc>
         procname <handle> <idx> <text>

         Description: used for partyline commands; the command is the first
           word and everything else becomes the text argument. The idx is
           valid until the user disconnects. After that, it may be reused,
           so be careful about storing an idx for long periods of time.
         Module: core

    (3)  FIL
         bind fil <flags> <command> <proc>
         procname <handle> <idx> <text>

         Description: the same as DCC, except this is triggered if the user
           is in the file area instead of the party line
         Module: filesys

    (4)  PUB
         bind pub <flags> <command> <proc>
         procname <nick> <user@host> <handle> <channel> <text>

         Description: used for commands given on a channel. The first word
           becomes the command and everything else is the text argument.
         Module: irc

    (5)  MSGM (stackable)
         bind msgm <flags> <mask> <proc>
         procname <nick> <user@host> <handle> <text>

         Description: matches the entire line of text from a /msg with the
           mask. This is useful for binding Tcl procs to words or phrases
           spoken anywhere within a line of text. If the proc returns 1,
           Eggdrop will not log the message that triggered this bind.
           MSGM binds are processed before MSG binds. If the exclusive-binds
           setting is enabled, MSG binds will not be triggered by text that
           a MSGM bind has already handled.
         Module: server

    (6)  PUBM (stackable)
         bind pubm <flags> <mask> <proc>
         procname <nick> <user@host> <handle> <channel> <text>

         Description: just like MSGM, except it's triggered by things said
           on a channel instead of things /msg'd to the bot. The mask is
           matched against the channel name followed by the text and can
           contain wildcards. If the proc returns 1, Eggdrop will not log
           the message that triggered this bind. PUBM binds are processed
           before PUB binds. If the exclusive-binds setting is enabled,
           PUB binds will not be triggered by text that a PUBM bind has
           already handled.
         Module: irc

    (7)  NOTC (stackable)
         bind notc <flags> <mask> <proc>
         procname <nick> <user@host> <handle> <text> <dest>

         Description: dest will be a nickname (the bot's nickname,
           obviously) or a channel name. mask is matched against the entire
           notice and can contain wildcards. It is considered a breach of
           protocol to respond to a /notice on IRC, so this is intended for
           internal use (logging, etc.) only. Note that server notices do
           not trigger the NOTC bind. If the proc returns 1, Eggdrop will
           not log the message that triggered this bind.

           New Tcl procs should be declared as
             proc notcproc {nick uhost hand text {dest ""}} {
               global botnick; if {$dest == ""} {set dest $botnick}
               ...
             }
           for compatibility.
         Module: server

    (8)  JOIN (stackable)
         bind join <flags> <mask> <proc>
         procname <nick> <user@host> <handle> <channel>

         Description: triggered by someone joining the channel. The mask in
           the bind is matched against "#channel nick!user@host" and can
           contain wildcards.
         Module: irc

    (9)  PART (stackable)
         bind part <flags> <mask> <proc>
         procname <nick> <user@host> <handle> <channel> <msg>

         Description: triggered by someone leaving the channel. The mask is
           matched against "#channel nick!user@host" and can contain
           wildcards. If no part message is specified, msg will be set
           to "".

           New Tcl procs should be declared as
             proc partproc {nick uhost hand chan {msg ""}} { ... }
           for compatibility.
         Module: irc

    (10) SIGN (stackable)
         bind sign <flags> <mask> <proc>
         procname <nick> <user@host> <handle> <channel> <reason>

         Description: triggered by a signoff, or possibly by someone who got
           netsplit and never returned. The signoff message is the last
           argument to the proc. Wildcards can be used in the mask, which is
           matched against '#channel nick!user@host'.
         Module: irc

    (11) TOPC (stackable)
         bind topc <flags> <mask> <proc>
         procname <nick> <user@host> <handle> <channel> <topic>

         Description: triggered by a topic change. mask can contain wildcards
           and is matched against '#channel <new topic>'.
         Module: irc

    (12) KICK (stackable)
         bind kick <flags> <mask> <proc>
         procname <nick> <user@host> <handle> <channel> <target> <reason>

         Description: triggered when someone is kicked off the channel. The
           mask is matched against '#channel target reason' where the target is
           the nickname of the person who got kicked (can contain wildcards).
           The proc is called with the nick, user@host, and handle of the
           kicker, plus the channel, the nickname of the person who was
           kicked, and the reason.
         Module: irc

    (13) NICK (stackable)
         bind nick <flags> <mask> <proc>
         procname <nick> <user@host> <handle> <channel> <newnick>

         Description: triggered when someone changes nicknames. The mask
           is matched against '#channel newnick' and can contain wildcards.
           Channel is "*" if the user isn't on a channel (usually the bot not
           yet in a channel).
         Module: irc

    (14) MODE (stackable)
         bind mode <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <nick> <user@host> <handle> <channel> <mode-change> <target>

         Description: mode changes are broken down into their component
           parts before being sent here, so the <mode-change> will always
           be a single mode, such as "+m" or "-o". target will show the
           argument of the mode change (for o/v/b/e/I) or "" if the set
           mode does not take an argument. The bot's automatic response
           to a mode change will happen AFTER all matching Tcl procs are
           called. The mask will be matched against '#channel +/-modes'
           and can contain wildcards.

           If it is a server mode, nick will be "", user@host is the server
           name, and handle is *.

           Note that "target" was added in 1.3.17 and that this will break
           Tcl scripts that were written for pre-1.3.17 Eggdrop that use the
           mode binding. Also, due to a typo, mode binds were broken
           completely in 1.3.17 but were fixed in 1.3.18. Mode bindings are
           not triggered at all in 1.3.17.

           One easy example (from guppy) of how to support the "target"
           parameter in 1.3.18 and later and still remain compatible with
           older Eggdrop versions is:

           Old script looks as follows:
             bind mode - * mode_proc
             proc mode_proc {nick uhost hand chan mode} { ... }

           To make it work with 1.3.18+ and stay compatible with older bots, do:
             bind mode - * mode_proc_fix
             proc mode_proc_fix {nick uhost hand chan mode {target ""}} {
               if {$target != ""} {append mode " $target"}
               mode_proc $nick $uhost $hand $chan $mode
             }
             proc mode_proc {nick uhost hand chan mode} { ... }
         Module: irc


    (15) CTCP (stackable)
         bind ctcp <flags> <keyword> <proc>
         proc-name <nick> <user@host> <handle> <dest> <keyword> <text>

         Description: dest will be a nickname (the bot's nickname, obviously)
           or channel name. keyword is the ctcp command (which can contain
           wildcards), and text may be empty. If the proc returns 0, the bot
           will attempt its own processing of the ctcp command.
         Module: server

    (16) CTCR (stackable)
         bind ctcr <flags> <keyword> <proc>
         proc-name <nick> <user@host> <handle> <dest> <keyword> <text>

         Description: just like ctcp, but this is triggered for a ctcp-reply
           (ctcp embedded in a notice instead of a privmsg)
         Module: server

    (17) RAW (stackable)
         bind raw <flags> <keyword> <proc>
         procname <from> <keyword> <text>

         Description: previous versions of Eggdrop required a special compile
           option to enable this binding, but it's now standard. The keyword
           is either a numeric, like "368", or a keyword, such as "PRIVMSG".
           from will be the server name or the source user (depending on
           the keyword); flags are ignored. The order of the arguments is
           identical to the order that the IRC server sends to the bot. The
           pre-processing  only splits it apart enough to determine the
           keyword. If the proc returns 1, Eggdrop will not process the line
           any further (this could cause unexpected behavior in some cases).
         Module: server

    (18) BOT
         bind bot <flags> <command> <proc>
         proc-name <from-bot> <command> <text>

         Description: triggered by a message coming from another bot in
           the botnet. The first word is the command and the rest becomes
           the text argument; flags are ignored.
         Module: core

    (19) CHON (stackable)
         bind chon <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <handle> <idx>

         Description: when someone first enters the party-line area of the
           bot via dcc chat or telnet, this is triggered before they are
           connected to a chat channel (so, yes, you can change the channel
           in a 'chon' proc). mask is matched against the handle and supports
           wildcards. This is NOT triggered when someone returns from the
           file area, etc.
         Module: core

    (20) CHOF (stackable)
         bind chof <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <handle> <idx>

         Description: triggered when someone leaves the party line to
           disconnect from the bot. mask is matched against the handle and
           can contain wildcards. Note that the connection may have already
           been dropped by the user, so don't send output to the idx.
         Module: core

    (21) SENT (stackable)
         bind sent <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <handle> <nick> <path/to/file>

         Description: after a user has successfully downloaded a file from
           the bot, this binding is triggered. mask is matched against the
           handle of the user that initiated the transfer and supports
           wildcards. nick is the actual recipient (on IRC) of the file. The
           path is relative to the dcc directory (unless the file transfer
           was started by a script call to 'dccsend', in which case the path
           is the exact path given in the call to 'dccsend').
         Module: transfer

    (22) RCVD (stackable)
         bind rcvd <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <handle> <nick> <path/to/file>

         Description: triggered after a user uploads a file successfully.
           mask is matched against the user's handle. nick is the IRC
           nickname that the file transfer originated from. The path is
           where the file ended up, relative to the dcc directory (usually
           this is your incoming dir).
         Module: transfer

    (23) CHAT (stackable)
         bind chat <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <handle> <channel#> <text>

         Description: when a user says something on the botnet, it invokes
           this binding. Flags are ignored; handle could be a user on this
           bot ("DronePup") or on another bot ("Eden@Wilde") and therefore
           you can't rely on a local user record. The mask is checked against
           the entire line of text and supports wildcards.

           NOTE: If a BOT says something on the botnet, the BCST bind is
           invoked instead.
         Module: core

    (24) LINK (stackable)
         bind link <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <botname> <via>

         Description: triggered when a bot links into the botnet. botname
           is the botnetnick of the bot that just linked in; via is the bot
           it linked through. The mask is checked against the botnetnick of
           the bot that linked and supports wildcards. flags are ignored.
         Module: core

    (25) DISC (stackable)
         bind disc <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <botname>

         Description: triggered when a bot disconnects from the botnet for
           whatever reason. Just like the link bind, flags are ignored; mask
           is matched against the botnetnick of the bot that unlinked.
           Wildcards are supported in mask.
         Module: core

    (26) SPLT (stackable)
         bind splt <flags> <mask> <proc>
         procname <nick> <user@host> <handle> <channel>

         Description: triggered when someone gets netsplit on the channel.
           Be aware that this may be a false alarm (it's easy to fake a
           netsplit signoff message on some networks); mask may contain
           wildcards and is matched against '#channel nick!user@host'.
           Anyone who is SPLT will trigger a REJN or SIGN within the next
           wait-split (defined in the config file) minutes.
         Module: irc

    (27) REJN (stackable)
         bind rejn <flags> <mask> <proc>
         procname <nick> <user@host> <handle> <channel>

         Description: someone who was split has rejoined. mask can contain
           wildcards, and is matched against '#channel nick!user@host'.
         Module: irc

    (28) FILT (stackable)
         bind filt <flags> <mask> <proc>
         procname <idx> <text>

         Description: party line and file system users have their text sent
           through filt before being processed. If the proc returns a blank
           string, the text is considered parsed. Otherwise, the bot will use
           the text returned from the proc and continue parsing that
         Module: core

    (29) NEED (stackable)
         bind need <flags> <mask> <proc>
         procname <channel> <type>

         Description: this bind is triggered on certain events, like when
           the bot needs operator status or the key for a channel. The
           types are: op, unban, invite, limit, and key; the mask is
           matched against '#channel type' and can contain wildcards. flags
           are ignored.

           Example:
             bind need - "% op" needop < handles only need op
             bind need - "*" needall   < handles all needs
         Module: irc

    (30) FLUD (stackable)
         bind flud <flags> <type> <proc>
         procname <nick> <user@host> <handle> <type> <channel>

         Description: any floods detected through the flood control settings
           (like 'flood-ctcp') are sent here before processing. If the proc
           returns 1, no further action is taken on the flood; if the proc
           returns 0, the bot will do its normal "punishment" for the flood.
           The flood types are: pub, msg, join, or ctcp (and can be masked to
           "*" for the bind); flags are ignored.
         Module: server

    (31) NOTE (stackable)
         bind note <flags> <mask> <proc>
         procname <from> <to> <text>
 
         Description: incoming notes (either from the party line, someone on
           IRC, or someone on another bot on the botnet) are checked against
           these binds before being processed. The mask is matched against
           the receiving handle and supports wildcards. If the proc returns 1,
           Eggdrop will not process the note any further. Flags are ignored.
         Module: core

    (32) ACT (stackable)
         bind act <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <handle> <channel#> <action>

         Description: when someone does an action on the botnet, it invokes
           this binding. flags are ignored; the mask is matched against the
           text of the action and can support wildcards.
         Module: core

   (33) WALL (stackable)
        bind wall <flags> <mask> <proc>
        proc-name <from> <msg>

        Description: when the bot receives a wallops, it invokes this
          binding. flags are ignored; the mask is matched against the text
          of the wallops msg. Note that RFC shows the server name as a source
          of the message, whereas many IRCds send the nick!user@host of the
          actual sender, thus, Eggdrop will not parse it at all, but simply
          pass it to bind in its original form. If the proc returns 1,
          Eggdrop will not log the message that triggered this bind.
        Module: server

    (34) BCST (stackable)
         bind bcst <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <botname> <channel#> <text>
 
         Description: when a bot broadcasts something on the botnet (see
           'dccbroadcast' above), it invokes this binding. flags are ignored;
           the mask is matched against the message text and can contain
           wildcards. 'channel' argument will always be '-1' since broadcasts
           are not directed to any partyline channel.
 
           It is also invoked when a BOT (not a person, as with the CHAT bind)
           'says' something on a channel. In this case, the 'channel' argument
           will be a valid channel, and not '-1'.
         Module: core

    (35) CHJN (stackable)
         bind chjn <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <botname> <handle> <channel#> <flag> <idx> <user@host>

         Description: when someone joins a botnet channel, it invokes this
           binding. The mask is matched against the channel and can contain
           wildcards. flag is one of: * (owner), + (master), @ (op), or %
           (botnet master). Flags are ignored.
         Module: core

    (36) CHPT (stackable)
         bind chpt <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <botname> <handle> <idx> <channel#>

         Description: when someone parts a botnet channel, it invokes this
           binding. The mask is matched against the channel and can contain
           wildcards. Flags are ignored.
         Module: core

    (37) TIME (stackable)
         bind time <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <minute> <hour> <day> <month> <year>

         Description: allows you to schedule procedure calls at certain
           times. mask matches 5 space separated integers of the form:
           "minute hour day month year". minute, hour, day, month have a
           zero padding so they are exactly two characters long; year is
           four characters. Flags are ignored.
         Module: core

    (38) AWAY (stackable)
         bind away <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <botname> <idx> <text>

         Description: triggers when a user goes away or comes back on the
           botnet. text is the reason than has been specified (text is ""
           when returning). mask is matched against the botnet-nick of the
           bot the user is connected to and supports wildcards. flags are
           ignored.
         Module: core

    (39) LOAD (stackable)
         bind load <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <module>

         Description: triggers when a module is loaded. mask is matched
           against the name of the loaded module and supports wildcards;
           flags are ignored.
         Module: core

    (40) UNLD (stackable)
         bind unld <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <module>

         Description: triggers when a module is unloaded. mask is matched
           against the name of the unloaded module and supports wildcards;
           flags are ignored.
         Module: core

    (41) NKCH (stackable)
         bind nkch <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <oldhandle> <newhandle>

         Description: triggered whenever a local user's handle is changed
           (in the userfile). mask is matched against the user's old handle
           and can contain wildcards; flags are ignored.
         Module: core

    (42) EVNT (stackable)
         bind evnt <flags> <type> <proc>
         proc-name <type>

         Description: triggered whenever one of these events happen. flags
           are ignored; valid events are:
             sighup          - called on a kill -HUP <pid>
             sigterm         - called on a kill -TERM <pid>

             prerestart      - called just before a restart
             logfile         - called when the logs are switched daily
             loaded          - called when the bot is done loading
             userfile-loaded - called after userfile has been loaded

             connect-server    - called just before we connect to an IRC server
             init-server       - called when we actually get on our IRC server

         Module: core

    (43) LOST (stackable)
         bind lost <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <handle> <nick> <path> <bytes-transferred> <length-of-file>

         Description: triggered when a DCC SEND transfer gets lost, such as
           when the connection is terminated before all data was successfully
           sent/received. This is typically caused by a user abort.
         Module: transfer

    (44) TOUT (stackable)
         bind tout <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <handle> <nick> <path> <bytes-transferred> <length-of-file>

         Description: triggered when a DCC SEND transfer times out. This may
           either happen because the dcc connection was not accepted or
           because the data transfer stalled for some reason.
         Module: transfer

    (45) OUT (stackable)
         bind out <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <queue> <message> <queued|sent>

         Description: triggered whenever output is sent to the server. Normally
           the event will occur twice for each line sent: once before entering
           a server queue and once after the message is actually sent. This
           allows for more flexible logging of server output and introduces
           the ability to cancel the message.
           Mask is matched against "queue status", where status is either
           'queued' or 'sent'. Queues are: mode, server, help, noqueue.
           noqueue is only used by the putnow tcl command.
         Module: server

    (46) CRON (stackable)
         bind cron <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <minute> <hour> <day> <month> <weekday>

         Description: similar to bind TIME, but the mask is evaluated as a cron
           expression, e.g. "16/2 */2 5-15 7,8,9 4". It can contain up to five
           fields: minute, hour, day, month, weekday; delimited by whitespace.
           Week days are represented as 0-6, where Sunday can be either 0 or 7.
           Symbolic names are not supported. The bind will be triggered if the
           mask matches all of the fields, except that if both day and weekday
           are not '*', only one of them is required to match. If any number of
           fields are omitted at the end, the match will proceed as if they were
           '*'. All cron operators are supported. Please refer to the crontab
           manual for their meanings. Flags are ignored.
         Module: core

    (47) LOG (stackable)
         bind log <flags> <mask> <proc>
         proc-name <level> <channel> <message>

         Description: triggered whenever a message is sent to a log. The mask is
           matched against "channel text".
           The level argument to the proc will contain the level(s) the message
           is sent to, or '*' if the message is sent to all log levels at once.
           If the message wasn't sent to a specific channel, channel will be set
           to '*'.
         Module: core

  (B) RETURN VALUES

    Several bindings pay attention to the value you return from the proc
    (using 'return <value>'). Usually, they expect a 0 or 1, and returning
    an empty return is interpreted as a 0. Be aware if you omit the return
    statement, the result of the last Tcl command executed will be returned
    by the proc. This will not likely produce the results you intended (this
    is a "feature" of Tcl).

    Here's a list of the bindings that use the return value from procs
    they trigger:

    (1) MSG   Return 1 to make Eggdrop log the command as:
                (nick!user@host) !handle! command

    (2) DCC   Return 1 to make Eggdrop log the command as:
                #handle# command

    (3) FIL   Return 1 to make Eggdrop log the command as:
                #handle# files: command

    (4) PUB   Return 1 to make Eggdrop log the command as:
                <<nick>> !handle! command

    (5) CTCP  Return 1 to ask the bot not to process the CTCP command on its
              own. Otherwise, it would send its own response to the CTCP
              (possibly an error message if it doesn't know how to deal with
              it).

    (6) FILT  Return "" to indicate the text has been processed, and the bot
              should just ignore it. Otherwise, it will treat the text like
              any other.

    (7) FLUD  Return 1 to ask the bot not to take action on the flood.
              Otherwise it will do its normal punishment.

    (8) RAW   Return 1 to ask the bot not to process the server text. This
              can affect the bot's performance by causing it to miss things
              that it would normally act on -- you have been warned.

    (9) CHON  Return 1 to ask the bot not to process the partyline join event.

    (10) CHOF  Return 1 to ask the bot not to process the partyline part event.

    (11) WALL  Return 1 to make Eggdrop not log the message that triggered
               this bind.

    (12) NOTE  Return 1 to make Eggdrop not process the note any further.
               This includes stacked note bindings that would be processed
               after this one, as well as the built-in eggdrop note handling
               routines.

    (13) MSGM  Return 1 to make Eggdrop not log the message that triggered
               this bind.

    (14) PUBM  Return 1 to make Eggdrop not log the message that triggered
               this bind.

    (15) NOTC  Return 1 to make Eggdrop not log the message that triggered
               this bind.

    (16) OUT   Return 1 to make Eggdrop drop the message instead of sending
               it. Only meaningful for messages with status "queued".

*** CONTROL PROCEDURES ***

  Using the 'control' command, you can put a DCC connection (or outgoing
  TCP connection) in control of a script. All text received from the
  connection is sent to the proc you specify. All outgoing text should
  be sent with 'putdcc'.

  The control procedure is called with these parameters:
    procname <idx> <input-text>

  This allows you to use the same proc for several connections. The
  idx will stay the same until the connection is dropped. After that,
  it will probably get reused for a later connection.

  To indicate that the connection has closed, your control procedure
  will be called with blank text (the input-text will be ""). This
  is the only time it will ever be called with "" as the text, and it
  is the last time your proc will be called for that connection. Don't
  call killdcc on the idx when text is blank, it will always fail with
  "invalid idx".

  If you want to hand control of your connection back to Eggdrop, your
  proc should return 1. Otherwise, return 0 to retain control.


*** TCP CONNECTIONS ***

  Eggdrop allows you to make two types of TCP ("telnet") connections:
  outgoing and incoming. For an outgoing connection, you specify the
  remote host and port to connect to. For an incoming connection, you
  specify a port to listen on.

  All of the connections are *event driven*. This means that the bot will
  trigger your procs when something happens on the connection, and your
  proc is expected to return as soon as possible. Waiting in a proc for
  more input is a no-no.

  To initiate an outgoing connection, use:
    set idx [connect <hostname> <port>]

  $idx now contains a new DCC entry for the outgoing connection.

  All connections use non-blocking (commonly called "asynchronous",
  which is a misnomer) I/O. Without going into a big song and dance
  about asynchronous I/O, what this means to you is:

    * assume the connection succeeded immediately
    * if the connection failed, an EOF will arrive for that idx

  The only time a 'connect' will return an error is if you give it a
  hostname that can't be resolved (this is considered a "DNS error").
  Otherwise, it will appear to have succeeded. If the connection failed,
  you will immediately get an EOF.

  Right after doing a 'connect' call, you should set up a 'control' for
  the new idx (see the section above). From then on, the connection will
  act just like a normal DCC connection that has been put under the control
  of a script. If you ever return "1" from the control proc (indicating
  that you want control to return to Eggdrop), the bot will just close the
  connection and dispose of it. Other commands that work on normal DCC
  connections, like 'killdcc' and 'putdcc', will work on this idx, too.
  The 'killdcc' command will fail with "invalid idx" if you attempt to use
  it on a closed socket.

  To create a listen port, use:
    listen <port> script <proc>

  Procs should be declared as:
    <procname> <newidx>

  For example:
    listen 6687 script listen:grab

    proc listen:grab {newidx} {
      control $newidx listen:control
    }

    When a new connection arrives in port 6687, Eggdrop will create a new
    idx for the connection. That idx is sent to 'listen:grab'. The proc
    immediately puts this idx under control. Once 'listen:grab' has been
    called, the idx behaves exactly like an outgoing connection would.

  The best way to learn how to use these commands is to find a script that
  uses them and follow it carefully. However, hopefully this has given you
  a good start.


*** MATCH CHARACTERS ***

  Many of the bindings allow match characters in the arguments. Here
  are the four special characters:

  ?  matches any single character
  *  matches 0 or more characters of any type
  %  matches 0 or more non-space characters (can be used to match a single
     word)
  ~  matches 1 or more space characters (can be used for whitespace between
     words)
