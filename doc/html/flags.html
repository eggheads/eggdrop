      <p><strong>Flags</strong></p>
    </div>
    <hr>

    <p>Eggdrop does not have access levels like some bots. There are no
    meaningless numbers or titles. Instead, each user has &quot;flags&quot;
    that entitle them to certain privileges. Think of a flag as a badge. Any
    user can have any number of flags -- you can have no flags, or you can
    have all of them. Some flags are good, some are bad. Each flag is
    identified by a letter.</p>

    <p>The standard global flags are:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>n (owner):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Someone who has absolute control -- you generally only want one
          or two people to have this flag.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>m (master):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Someone who has access to almost every feature of the bot.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>t (botnet):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Someone who has access to all features dealing with the
          botnet.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>x (xfer):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Someone who has access to the file transfer area of the bot (if
          it exists) and can send and receive files to/from the bot.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>j (janitor):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Someone who can perform maintenance in the file area of the bot
          (if it exists) -- like a &quot;master&quot; of the file area.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>c (common):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Marks a user who is really just a public IRC site from which any
          number of people can use IRC, making the user@host information
          useless.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>p (party):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Someone who has access to the party line.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>b (bot):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Marks a user that is really a bot.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>u (unshare):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>User record is not sent to other bots</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>h (hilite):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Use nice formatting codes, bold, inverse, etc. in the help
          files</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Also, there are 26 user-defined flags numbered A-Z (capitals). Bots
    can have specific flags which are explained later on. The channel flags
    for the bot are: <em>(these can also be applied globally, or on a
    channel-specific basis)</em></p>

    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>o (op):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Someone who can ask for channel op (+o) status on the channel at
          will.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>d (deop):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Someone who is not permitted to ever gain channel op status.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>k (kick):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Someone who should be kicked if they ever attempt to join the
          channel.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>f (friend):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If revenge mode is on, the bot won&#39;t take revenge on someone
          with this flag.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>m (master):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Someone who has the ability to add/delete/modify users on the
          channel.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>n (owner):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Someone who owns the channel and has access to a reasonable
          amount of commands.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>a (auto-op):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Automatically op the person when they join the channel even if
          the channel isn&#39;t +autoop.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>v (auto-voice):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Automatically give this person a voice it they join a +autovoice
          channel.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong> g(auto-voice):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Automatically give this person a voice even if the channel is
          not autovoice. Works similar to +a</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>q (quiet):</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Do not allow this person to get a voice on a +autovoice
          channel.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Once again there are 26 user-defined flags numbered A-Z, as channel
    flags.</p>
