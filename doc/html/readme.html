    <blockquote>
      <p>Please read this file carefully before trying to set up this bot.
      Also, make <strong>SURE</strong> that you select your +n (owner) users
      wisely! They have 100% access to your bot and account! <strong>ONLY
      GIVE THIS POWER TO SOMEONE YOU TRUST COMPLETELY!!</strong></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect2"></a>2. <strong>What is Eggdrop?</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eggdrop is an IRC bot, written in C. If you don&#39;t know what IRC
      is, this is probably not whatever you&#39;re looking for. Eggdrop,
      being a bot, sits on a channel and takes protective measures: to keep
      the channel from being taken over (in the few ways that anything can),
      to recognize banished users or sites and reject them, to recognize
      privileged users and let them gain ops, etc.</p>

      <p>One of the more unique features of Eggdrop is its &quot;party
      line&quot;, accessible via DCC chat and telnet, which allows you to
      talk to other people lag-free. Consider it a multi-way DCC chat, or a
      miniature IRC (complete with channels). You can link up with other
      bots and expand the party line until it actually becomes something
      very much like IRC, in fact.</p>

      <p>Eggdrop is always being improved and adjusted because there are
      bugs to be fixed and features to be added (if the users demand them,
      and they make actually sense). In fact, it existed for several years
      as v0.7 - v0.9 before finally going 1.0. This version of Eggdrop is
      part of the 1.6 tree. A valiant effort has been made to chase down and
      destroy bugs.</p>

      <p>This Readme file contains information about how to get Eggdrop, how
      to quickly compile the bot, what you may need to do when upgrading from
      older versions, a list of frequently asked questions about compiling,
      how to set up a crontab, some boring legal stuff, info about the
      mailing list (a great place to ask questions, and a good place to
      report bugs also), some basics about CVS usage and some channels where
      you might get help with Eggdrop.</p>

      <p>The preliminary documentation is in &quot;eggdrop.doc&quot; and is
      intended to be read after you have Eggdrop compiled and set up.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect3"></a>3. <strong>How to get Eggdrop</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Before you can compile Eggdrop, you need to have Tcl installed on
      your system. Most systems should have Tcl on them by now -- you can
      check by trying the command &quot;tclsh&quot;. If it works, you will be
      given a &quot;%&quot; prompt, and you can type &quot;exit&quot; to exit
      the program. That means Tcl is on your system. If tclsh doesn&#39;t
      load, then Tcl probably isn&#39;t on your system, and you will need to
      ftp it.</p>

      <p>The best ftp site for Tcl is:<br>
      <a href="ftp://ftp.scriptics.com/pub/tcl/">
      ftp://ftp.scriptics.com/pub/tcl/</a></p>

      <p>Tcl comes with the Slackware distribution of Linux. HOWEVER, the one
      that comes on Slackware 3.0 is goofed up and you&#39;ll have to
      reinstall it for yourself to get it working.</p>

      <p>Currently, the 1.6 tree of Eggdrop is developed at eggheads.org. You
      can get the latest version of Eggdrop from:
      <a href="ftp://ftp.eggheads.org/pub/eggdrop/">
      ftp://ftp.eggheads.org/pub/eggdrop/</a></p>

      <p>You might also try <a href="http://www.eggheads.org/">
      www.eggheads.org</a> for more help and information.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect3a"></a>3a. <strong>How to get the latest version of
    eggdrop via CVS</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You may obtain the <strong>very latest</strong> version of Eggdrop
      that is still under development by using CVS. CVS means &#39;Concurrent
      Versions System&#39; and is a tool for developers to always keep source
      code up to date. Try &#39;man cvs&#39; on your shell for more
      information about CVS.</p>

      <p>This intended only for users that know a fairly bit about Eggdrop.
      Be aware that the versions of Eggdrop that you get by CVS are still
      being developed, and may be buggy. The Eggheads devteam will in *NO
      WAY* take any responsibility for whatever might happen to you or your
      shell if you use a CVS version of Eggdrop.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>To obtain Eggdrop via CVS:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>log into your shell</li>

        <li>type &#39;export
        CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.eggheads.org:/usr/local/cvsroot&#39;</li>

        <li>type &#39;cvs login&#39;</li>

        <li>press &lt;enter&gt; when it asks for a password.</li>

        <li>in your home dir, type &#39;cvs checkout eggdrop1.6&#39;</li>

        <li>in ~/eggdrop1.6, you should have a copy of the latest CVS version
        of Eggdrop.</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Notes:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>you can &#39;cvs logout&#39;, but you don&#39;t need to.</li>

        <li>you don&#39;t need to go through this whole process every time;
        if you want to get a CVS version of Eggdrop at a later time, you can
        just &#39;cd ~/eggdrop1.6&#39; and type &#39;cvs update
        -dAP&#39;.</li>

        <li>if you experience errors when using &#39;export&#39;, you might
        be using tclsh as a shell. If so, try using the command
        &#39;setenv&#39; instead of &#39;export&#39;: &#39;setenv CVSROOT
        :pserver:anonymous@cvs.eggheads.org:/usr/local/cvsroot&#39;</li>
      </ol>

    <p><a name="sect4"></a>4. <strong>Quick startup</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Please see the <a href="install.html">Installation file</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect5"></a>5. <strong>Upgrading</strong></p>

    <p><a name="sect5a"></a>5a. <strong>from a pre-1.3 version to
    1.6</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>BACK UP YOUR USERFILE</strong></p>

      <p>We can&#39;t stress this enough, if you are upgrading, and you have
      even a slight possibility of downgrading again later you will HAVE to
      back up your userfile, or you will lose it. v1.3 of Eggdrop radically
      changed alot of things.</p>

      <p> There are many major changes between v0.9, v1.0, v1.1 and
      v1.6 so PAY ATTENTION to this part if you have a v0.9, 1.0 or
      1.1 bot already. If you&#39;re just starting out, you can skip this
      section.</p>

      <p>to 1.6: * If you run share bots, you will need to upgrade
      them all at the same time because of the new userfile format. Older
      bots will be able to link in, but will not get or send a userfile.
      MAKE A NEW CONFIG FILE from the example, there are some radical
      extras.</p>

      <p>from 0.9/1.0 to 1.6: * Just redo the whole thing, absolutely
      everything has changed including the userfile and config file
      formats.</p>

      <p>from 1.1/1.2 to 1.6: * You will likely want to redo the
      config file, as much as changed. BACK UP!! You will need to run
      &#39;tclsh scripts/weed/&lt;userfile&gt; c&#39; to convert your
      userfile from v3 (1.1/1.2) to v4 (1.3/1.4/1.5/1.6)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect5b"></a>5b. <strong>from an older 1.3/1.4/1.5/1.6 version to
    a newer one</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>If you followed the <a href="install.html">Installation file</a>
      and did a &#39;make install&#39; (or &#39;make DEST=&quot;path&quot;
      install&#39;) after &#39;make&#39;, this will be pretty easy. Just
      upload the new eggdrop1.6.x.tar.gz file to the home dir of your
      shell, gunzip and untar it, and type &#39;cd ~/eggdrop1.6.x&#39;.
      Then, type &#39;./configure&#39;, &#39;make config&#39; or
      &#39;make iconfig&#39;, &#39;make&#39;, then kill the bot
      (&#39;.die&#39; on the party line, or use &#39;kill&#39; on the shell)
      and &#39;make install&#39; to the same directory your bot is currently
      in. Then, you can just restart your bot. You may wish to delete the
      old eggdrop executable and modules as well, especially if you have
      limited disk space.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect6"></a>6. <strong>Setting up a crontab</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eggdrop has become more stable with time, thanks mostly to people
      reporting bug details and helping find places where it crashes.
      However, there are still a -few- places where things aren&#39;t
      perfect. Few if any things in life are.</p>

      <p>Also, most systems go down from time to time. These things cause
      your bot to disappear from IRC, and you have to restart it.</p>

      <p>The Eggdrop source file includes a shell script called
      &#39;botchk&#39; that will help keep the bot online. It will make the
      machine check every ten minutes to make sure your bot is still running.
      To use it, you have to add a line to your crontab. First, edit
      &#39;botchk&#39; and change the directory and command line parameters
      so that it will be able to start up your bot. Then, add this line to
      your crontab:</p>

      <p>0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /home/mydir/botchk</p>

      <p>If you don&#39;t want to get emails from cron, put this:</p>

      <p>0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /home/mydir/botchk &gt;/dev/null
      2&gt;&amp;1</p>

      <p> Naturally, you need to change the path to the correct path for
      botchk. If you&#39;ve never used crontab before, here is a simple way
      to add that line: Create a new file called &#39;mycron&#39; and put the
      above line into it. Then, from your shell prompt, type % crontab mycron
      That will create a new crontab entry for you, with a line that runs
      botchk every ten minutes. Botchk will then restart the bot when
      necessary (and send you email informing you).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect6a"></a>6a. <strong>Setting up a crontab using
    autobotchk</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Included with your Eggdrop is a utility called &#39;autobotchk&#39;.
      Using autobotchk is probably the fastest way of creating your botchk
      and adding it to crontab with just a few required steps.</p>

      <p>To crontab your bot follow the following steps:</p>

      <p>(1) type &#39;cp scripts/autobotchk ..&#39;<br>
       (2) type &#39;./autobotchk &lt;eggdrop config file&gt;&#39;</p>

      <p>This will hopefully crontab your bot using the default setup. If you
      want a list of autobotchk options, type &#39;./autobotchk&#39;. An
      example with options would be:</p>

      <p>./autobotchk eggdrop.conf -noemail -5</p>

      <p>This would setup crontab to run the botchk every 5 minutes and also
      to not send you e-mail saying that it restarted your bot.</p>

    <p><a name="sect8"></a>8. <strong>Mailing list</strong></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>There are currently a couple of mailing lists about Eggdrop.
      <a href="mailto:eggheads@eggheads.org">eggheads@eggheads.org</a>
      is the one relevant for posts about Eggdrop 1.4 and up (and bug
      fixes, and suggestions, etc).</p>

      <p>To subscribe to the eggheads mailing list, send email to:
      <a href="mailto:eggheads-request@eggheads.org">

      <p><strong>DO NOT SEND ROBEY EMAIL ABOUT EGGDROP</strong></p>

      <p>Robey is no longer developing the Eggdrop code (although he does put
      a word in every now and then) so don&#39;t bother emailing him. If you
      have a serious problem, email the Eggdrop mailing list and it will get
      to the coders.</p>

      <p> Please, before posting to this list, see what things are like, and
      when you do post, read over your post for readability, spelling, and
      grammar mistakes. Obviously, we&#39;re all human (or are we?) and we
      all make mistakes (heck, look at this document! ;).</p>

      <p>Open discussion and debate is integral to change and progress.
      Don&#39;t flame others over mere form (grammar and spelling), or even
      substantive issues either for that matter. Please read and follow the
      mailing list rules.</p>

      <p>The <a href="mailto:eggheads@eggheads.org">
      eggheads@eggheads.org</a> maillist is not dedicated to those all too
      common questions we have all seen on other lists... for example:</p>

      <p> &quot;Why does my bot say this: Please edit your config
      file.&quot;<br>
       &quot;How do I telnet my bot?&quot;<br>
       &quot;Where do I get Eggdrop for windows??????&quot;<br>
       etc...</p>

      <p>Bug reports, technical questions, your thoughts or suggestions on
      new features being added to Eggdrop, things that should be removed or
      fixed, amazing problems that even stump the guru&#39;s, etc... are what
      we want to see here.</p>

      <p>There is currently no uniform IRC channel in existence to support
      Eggdrop. At one time, such channels did exist, but they most often
      deteriorate into a vanity channel, where no one is willing to help.</p>

      <p>However, we&#39;ll list a few places here where you *might* get
      help. Note though that we are not responsible for those channels, or
      necessarily run those channels ourselves.</p>

      <p>If you plan to ask questions in any of the above channels,
      you should be familiar with and follow IRC etiquette.</p>

      <p>Some important things to remember:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Don't ask if you can ask a question, ask your question once and
        wait. If anyone is there that can help, they will answer you.</li>

        <li>Don't /msg people without their permission.</li>

        <li>Don't repeat or paste large amounts of text to the channel.</li>

        <li>Don't type using CAPITAL letters, colors or use ! and ?
        excessively.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you break these rules, you may find yourself
      <strong>ignored</strong>, or even <strong>kicked</strong> and or
      <strong>banned</strong> from the channel.</p>

      <p>If there are any other serious eggdrop related channels that should
      be added to the above list, please let us know.</p>
