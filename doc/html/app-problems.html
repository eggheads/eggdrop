    <p><strong>Things that are broke, but aren&#39;t getting fixed anytime
    soon</strong></p>

    <p>Solve to non-working alarm(10) in Linux (calls to gethostbyaddr/name()
    have blocked for long periods when bind/named doesn&#39;t resolve
    quickly, and the alarm does not interrupt it).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Note: This should now work if you use the dns module.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>High-bit characters are being filtered from channel names. This is a
    fault of the TCL interpreter, and not Eggdrop. The Tcl interpreter
    filters the characters when it reads a file for interpreting.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Note: This should now work if you use Tcl 8.1 or later.</p>
