    <p><strong>Things that are broke, but aren&#39;t getting fixed anytime
    soon:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Non-working alarm(10) in Linux (calls to gethostbyaddr/name()
          have blocked for long periods when bind/named doesn&#39;t resolve
          quickly, and the alarm does not interrupt it).</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Note: This should now work if you use the dns module.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>High-bit characters are being filtered from channel names.
          This is a fault of the Tcl interpreter, and not Eggdrop. The Tcl
          interpreter filters the characters when it reads a file for
          interpreting. Update your Tcl to version 8.1 or higher.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Version 8.1 of Tcl doesn&#39;t support unicode characters, for
          example, &egrave;. If those characters are handled in a script as
          text, you run into errors. Eggdrop can&#39;t handle these errors at
          the moment.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
