    <p>Some little tricks that you may or may not know about...</p>

    <p>You can &quot;lock&quot; a user&#39;s info line by putting a
    &#39;@&#39; as the first letter. They won&#39;t be able to change it any
    more.</p>

    <p>&#39;.status all&#39; will dump out virtually everything you have
    configured on your bot</p>

    <p>TCL has a command &#39;info body &lt;proc&gt;&#39; that will list the
    contents of a proc. &#39;info args &lt;proc&gt;&#39; shows what you have
    defined as the parameters for the proc.</p>

    <p>You can rename a builtin command by binding over it. To rename
    &#39;.status&#39; to &#39;.report&#39;, you&#39;d do:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>unbind dcc - status *dcc:status<br>
       bind dcc m report *dcc:status</p>

      <p>The first line removes the builtin binding on &#39;.status&#39;, and
      the second line binds &#39;.report&#39; to the builtin status function.
      Other built-in command examples include:</p>

      <p>unbind msg - status *msg:status<br>
       bind msg m report *msg:status</p>

      <p>and:</p>

      <p>unbind fil - share *fil:share<br>
       bind fil m link *fil:share</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>You can unlink all bots and clear out the botnet info from memory by
    using &#39;.unlink *&#39;. It erases all channel assocs and
    everything.</p>

    <p>You can automagically make a ban sticky by adding a &#39;*&#39; as the
    first character in the ban reason.</p>

    <p>You can add a user with a static hostmask when using
    &#39;.adduser&#39; by prefixing their nick by &#39;!&#39;.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>ie with a hostmask of drummer!ident@some.host.com</p>

      <p>&#39;.adduser drummer&#39;</p>

      <p>uses *!ident@*.host.com</p>

      <p>&#39;.adduser !drummer&#39;</p>

      <p>uses *!ident@some.host.com</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If you don&#39;t want your logfiles to be deleted after two days and
    don&#39;t want the bot to create a new logfile each new day, then set
    &#39;keep-all-logs&#39; to 0 and &#39;switch-logfiles-at&#39; to 2500 in
    your bot config file to make it keeping one logfile all the time. However
    this is not recommended on high traffic channels.</p>

    <p>You can modify eggdrop&#39;s output in partyline and messages by
    editing core.english.lang in the language directory.</p>
