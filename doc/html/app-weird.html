      <p><strong>Weird Messages That Get Logged</strong></p>
    </div>
    <hr>

    <p>Shown below are some messages that Eggdrop might log from time to time
    that are a bit strange and don&#39;t make it really that obvious what
    it&#39;s harping on about:</p>

    <p><strong>(!) timer drift -- spun N minutes</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This is caused by one of several known things...</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Your bot was swapped out of memory for a while, or that for some
        reason the computer stopped letting the bot run. Once a minute,
        Eggdrop does a few maintanance things, including counting down any
        Tcl timers you have going. If for some reason, several minutes pass
        without Eggdrop getting to do this, it logs this message to let you
        know what happened. It&#39;s generally a bad thing, because it means
        that the system your bot is on is very busy, and the bot can hardly
        keep track of the channel very well when it gets swapped out for
        minutes at a time.</li>

        <li>On some systems (at least Linux) if the dns your bot is using to
        lookup hostnames is broken, and *very* slow in responding (this can
        occur if the dns&#39;s uplink doesn&#39;t exist) then you will get
        4/5 minute time drifts continuously, not much can be done about this,
        it&#39;s an operating system problem :(</li>

        <li>The clock on your machine has just been changed (e.g. it was
        running behind by several minutes and was just corrected)</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>(!) killmember(Nickname) -&gt; nonexistant</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>We have yet to track this down. It&#39;s a mildly bad thing, though.
      It means the bot just got informed by the server that someone left the
      channel -- but the bot has no record of that person ever being ON the
      channel.</p>

      <p>jwilkinson@mail.utexas.edu had some insight into this one:</p>

      <p>This is not an Eggdrop bug, at least not most of the time. This is a
      bug in all but perhaps the very latest ircd systems. It&#39;s not
      uncommon during netsplits and other joins for the server to lose track
      of killed or collided join notices. Also, in some servers, it is
      possible to specify non-standard characters, such as carret symbols,
      which get falsely interpreted as capital letters.</p>

      <p>When converted to lowercase, these symbols fail to get processed,
      and joins are not reported, although parts are.</p>
