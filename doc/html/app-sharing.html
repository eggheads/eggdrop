      <p><strong>Botnet Sharing and Linking</strong></p>
    </div>
    <hr>

    <p>This document is designed to help you with a working knowledge of
    botnets.</p>

    <p>This document includes bot flags, sharing and linking bots. This only
    covers the 1.3.x and later versions of Eggdrop. Many things have changed
    in the way flags are handled and the way user-files are shared. The code
    has been stream-lined and made more efficient. Even if you have used
    previous version you should still glance over this document to find out
    what changes have been made. It will take some time to get used to but
    you will see its all for the better.</p>

    <p><strong>Terms</strong></p>

    <p>The following are some common terms that will be used in this
    document. Also the associated command(s) if applicable.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Botnet</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The term used to describe multiple bots connected together.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Link</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The term that means the actual linking of more than one bot<br>
           (.link .unlink)</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Flags</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Flags are attributes that determine what a bot can and can&#39;t
          do. Flags can be either global or channel specific. The main ones
          that affect a botnet are +h(hub), +a(alt hub) +s(passive share), +s
          (channel share), +p (passive share), +g (global share).<br>
           (.chattr, .botattr).</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Share</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The term used to describe two bots that share user records.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Aggressive Share</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Term used to describe the method of sharing user-files.
          Aggressive share bot will only receive users from a passive
          bot.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Passive Share</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Term used to describe the method of sharing user-files. Passive
          share bots will only send users to another bot.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Address</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The physical address of the bot, i.e. the host address <em>
          &quot;eggdrop.com:3333&quot;</em> contains the port address of the
          bot also.<br>
           (.chaddr)</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Relay</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The relay port number of the bot, if defined in the config file.
          If defined in the config file the bot will use two separate ports.
          One for telnet connections to other bots and one for relay
          connections. A relay connection is used to relay (jump) to another
          bot in DCC chat. You can still relay to another bot even if this is
          not defined in the config file.<br>
           (.relay)</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Port</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The telnet port the bot uses to communicate with other bots.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Adding bots</strong></p>

    <p>With the common terms out of the way we can start with the process of
    adding a bot so you may connect them together. Before you start you will
    need to decide or know the following:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>Will it be a share bot?</li>

        <li>Which bot is the hub (+h) bot?</li>

        <li>Will there be a alternate hub (+a) bot?</li>

        <li>If sharing who gets what from whom?</li>

        <li>What are the domains and ports of the bots.</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <p>*NOTE*: For sharing to work modules: transfer, share, filesys must be
    loaded on all the bots, and the channel specific +s should be set for all
    channels to be shared.</p>

    <p>First off, let&#39;s say we have two bots we want to link. We will
    call one Lamestbot, and the other Lameshare. The first thing that needs
    to be done is each bot needs the other bot added to it&#39;s user record.
    Your botnet should have a hub bot. This will have them connect
    automatically whenever they are started. Without a hub you would have to
    manually link them with the .link command. For this situation we will
    make Lamestbot the hub for our small botnet. Let&#39;s also use a channel
    called #eggdrop as the one we want to share user channel flags with. Do
    the following:</p>

    <p>On Lamestbot:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>.+bot Lameshare eggdrop.com:3333 (This command adds a user record to
      Lamestbot for Lameshare. Lameshare is running from eggdrop.com and is
      on port 3333. If Lameshare were to have a separate port for
      users/relays we would just add a &#39;/&#39; and the port number i.e.
      3333/5555)</p>

      <p>.botattr Lameshare +s (this tells us that Lamestbot will only send
      user files to Lameshare, Lameshare will not send them to it)</p>

      <p>.botattr Lameshare |s #eggdrop (this sets up sharing of the channel
      flags for #eggdrop between the bots. Without this they will not share
      channel flags only global flags for the users.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>On Lameshare:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>.+bot Lamestbot best.com:3333/5555 (Again this will add a user on
      Lameshare called Lamestbot with the domain of best.com. The bot has two
      ports, 3333 for bot communications and 5555 for users/relays)</p>

      <p>.botattr Lamestbot +hp (this command sets Lamestbot as the hub and
      also as a passive share which means Lameshare will accept user files
      from Lamestbot.</p>

      <p>.botattr Lamestbot |+s #eggdrop (again sets #eggdrop as a share
      channel and that channel flags will be passed to Lameshare from
      Lamestbot)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>At this point the bots should be auto-connecting and sharing between
    themselves. HINT: don&#39;t assign the +h flag until you are ready for
    them to link. Depending on the speed of the box they may connect
    prematurely before you have all the flags set.</p>

    <p>Lamestbot (hub)<br>
     |<br>
     |<br>
     |<br>
     Lameshare</p>

    <p>Let&#39;s add a third bot called beldin to this scenario:</p>

    <p>On Lamestbot:</p>

    <blockquote>
      .+bot beldin llama.com:3333 

      <p>.botattr beldin s|s #eggdrop (notice how i piped (the | character)
      the channel flag also saving time.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Also note that you don&#39;t have to add beldin on Lameshare since
    they are already sharing it was added automatically. The one thing that
    you should note though is that no bot flags will be shared. Meaning that
    if you set beldin as +s (Aggressive share) on the hub (Lamestbot) he will
    not be set on the other bots as that. The same with the channel +s flag.
    All other flags will be shared such as the o f etc. Now that we have
    three bots we can also set up one as an alternate hub. The alternate hub
    is the bot that the bots will auto-connect to in the event the hub goes
    down and is unreachable.</p>

    <p>Let&#39;s make beldin an alternate hub for our little botnet</p>

    <p>On Lameshare:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>.botattr beldin +a</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>That&#39;s all there is to it. Again since bot flags are not shared
    you would have to add the bot flag +a for beldin on them all. The only
    ones you would not have to do this on are beldin, and the hub
    (Lamestbot). Of course if you had more bots you would have to add beldin
    as a +a to them but you would not do it on the hub or beldin.</p>

    <blockquote>
<pre>
                           Lamestbot (hub)___&lt; &gt;____Lameshare
                                        |_____&lt; &gt;______beldin
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>That&#39;s about it for sharing, again you could add subsequent bots
    the same way you added beldin.</p>
