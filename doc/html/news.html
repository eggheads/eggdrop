    <p><strong>News - Updated 30 December 2001</strong></p>

    <p>What&#39;s new? First, read the following documents:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="install.html">Install</a></li>

        <li><a href="readme.html">Readme</a></li>

        <li><a href="faqs.html">Faqs</a></li>

        <li><a href="botnet.html">Botnet</a></li>

        <li>UPDATES1.6</li>

        <li>tcl-commands.doc</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p>All of these documents combined will help fill you in on the latest
    changes to Eggdrop in version 1.6.x.</p>

    <p>A lot of things have changed in this version so at a minimum read 
    the UPDATES1.6 text file. UPDATES shows what&#39;s been added and fixed
    along the way.</p>

    <p><strong>If you are upgrading from a pre-1.6 version of Eggdrop:</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>Before you start the bot for the first time, <strong>BACKUP
        </strong> your userfile.</li>

        <li><strong>DON&#39;T USE YOUR OLD CONFIG FILE. MAKE A NEW ONE!
        </strong></li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Changes made to Eggdrop 1.6.x from Eggdrop1.4.x:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>!Channels</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Support for IRCnet !channels was added to Eggdrop. This might still
      be a bit buggy. We appreciate bug reports!</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>+/-nodesynch</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This new channel setting replaces the old &#39;allow-desync&#39;
      config file setting. This setting is useful 
      if you use some kind of chanserv or if you don&#39;t care about your
      channel being desynched.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Asynchronous Dns Module</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eggdrop 1.6 is shipped with a new module, the dns module. It 
      replaces those old dns-lookups performed by Eggdrop which could halt 
      the whole bot during a timeout. We also added a new Tcl command,
      &#39;dnslookup&#39;, so scripts can now use DNS functions 
      asynchronously, too.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Compress Module</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A new module called compress was introduced to Eggdrop. It provides
      gzip support to Eggdrop (via Tcl commands) and enables compressed 
      userfile transfer.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Share Module</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The share module has a new setting now (override-bots) which allows
     hub bots to override the leaf bot&#39;s bot settings (botadress, telnet
     port and password). Please note that this won&#39;t work with a version
     1.4 below bot.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Transfer / Filesys Modules</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The filesys and transfer modules have changed completely. Both can 
      now handle unlimited filename lengths and description sizes. Incomplete
      downloads from the bot can also now be resumed. The db format of the
      filesys module was changed to remove the limits imposed by the old
      format. There&#39;s nothing special for you to do, as the old db is 
      automatically converted to the new format when you first access it.
      You won&#39;t be able to downgrade to older versions after this, so
      you may want to make a backup first.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Uptime Module</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This module reports uptime statistics to 
      http://uptime.eggheads.org. Go look and see what your uptime is! It 
      takes about 9 hours to show up, so if your bot isn&#39;t listed, try
      again later. See doc/settings/mod.uptime for more information.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>DCC Commands</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>&quot;.nick&quot; was renamed to &quot;.handle&quot;. 
          &quot;.nick&quot; will still be kept up to version 1.8.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>&quot;.chnick&quot; was renamed to &quot;.chhandle&quot;. 
          &quot;.chnick&quot; will still be kept up to version 1.8.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>&quot;.binds&quot; supports now wildcards.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The &#39;optimise&#39; file system command was renamed to 
          &#39;optimize&#39;. The old command will still be kept up to 
          version 1.8.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Eggdrop now counts all of the traffic which it generates and
          receives through IRC, botnet, scripts, and dcc. You can access 
          these statistics via the dcc command &#39;.traffic&#39;. Please
          note that the counter gets reset every time a restart is done.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Channel Modes</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Support for IRCnet negative limits and DALnet&#39;s +R, +M, and +c 
      channel modes has been added.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Config Files</strong></p>
     
     <blockquote>
       <ul>
         <li>
           <p>eggdrop.conf.dist was replaced with three files: 
           eggdrop.simple.conf, eggdrop.advanced.conf, and 
           eggdrop.complete.conf. This allows users to choose how they 
           want to configure their bot. eggdrop.simple.conf contains the 
           simplest configuration options, eggdrop.advanced.conf goes more
           into detail, and eggdrop.complete.conf contains all possible
           settings.</p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
           <p>To support longer nicknames, as some IRC servers do, a new 
           &#39;nick-len&#39; setting was added.</p>
         </li>

         <li>
           <p>Eggdrop uses strftime now to support different logfile 
           suffixes. The new config file setting is &#39;logfile-suffix&#39;.
           </p>
         </li>

         <li>
           <p>A new &#39;pidfile&#39; setting was added to allow you to 
           specify the name of Eggdrop&#39;s pid file.</p>
         </li>
       </ul>
     </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Penalty Calculation</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eggdrop calculates penalty points on IRCnet now, so it won&#39;t
      flood itself off anymore.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Tcl Commands</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The chnick command was renamed to chhandle. The use of chnick 
          is deprecated. chnick is still accessible if you load compat.tcl.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>All three commands to add data to the queues (puthelp, putserv
          and putquick) now support the &#39;-next&#39; parameter which 
          pushes data to the front of the queue.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>A command to calculate md5 checksums, md5, was added.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>To support the new asynch dns module, the command 
          &#39;dnslookup&#39; was added.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Four new commands regarding exempts/invites were added: 
          stickexempt, unstickexempt, stickinvite, and unstickinvite.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>A new wasop command was added to check if a user had op before 
          a mode change.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Three new Tcl commands were added as part of the compress
          module: compressfile, uncompressfile, and iscompressed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>A new command to check whether the bot&#39;s nick is juped was
          added (isjuped).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The fileresend command was added to support mIRC&#39;s dcc resume
          feature.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>A new bind type called &#39;NEED&#39; was added which triggers 
          when the bot needs op, unban, limit, key, or invite.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>LOST and TOUT bind types were added. See doc/tcl-commands.doc 
          for more information.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Two new commands, channame2dname and chandname2name, were added
          to allow scripts to support !channels.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>A new evnt type, loaded, was added.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The &#39;setudef&#39; command was added to allow for 
          user-defined channel settings. See doc/tcl-commands.doc for more 
          information.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>A &#39;traffic&#39; command was added which returns a list of 
          sublists containing information about the bot&#39;s traffic usage
          in bytes.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The CTCP bind type now supports wildcards.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      doc/tcl-commands.doc</p>

    <p><strong>Traffic Accounting</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eggdrop now counts all of the traffic which it generates and 
      receives through IRC, botnet, scripts, and dcc. You can access these
      statistics via the dcc command &#39;.traffic&#39;. Please note that 
      the counter gets reset every time a restart is done.</p>
