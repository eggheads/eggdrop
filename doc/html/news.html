    <p><strong>News - Updated 21 March 2000</strong></p>

    <p>What&#39;s new, first read the following documents:</p>

      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p>All of these documents combined will help fill you in on the latest
    changes to eggdrop in version 1.6.x. Further down the file is changes
    made from the 1.3.x to the 1.4.x version of eggdrop.</p>

    <p>Alot of things have changed in this version so at a minimum read the
    UPDATES1.5, UPDATES1.6 and <a href="botnet.html">Botnet</a> text files. UPDATES
    shows what&#39;s been added and fixed along the way. BOTNET gives a
    comprehensive step by step guide on linking bots and the new bot
    flags.</p>

    <p><strong>CAUTION:</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>Before you start the bot for the first time BACKUP your userfile
        if this is an upgrade from a previous version.</li>

        <li>DON&#39;T USE YOUR OLD CONFIG FILE... MAKE A NEW ONE!</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Changes made to Eggdrop 1.6.x from Eggdrop1.4.x</strong></p>

    <p><strong>!channels</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Support for IRCNET !channels was added to eggdrop. Also this might
      be still a bit buggy, it should work basically. We appreciate bug
      reports!</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Asynchronous dns module</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eggdrop 1.5.1 is shipped with a new module, the dns module. It
      replaces those old dns-lookups performed by eggdrop which could halt
      the whole bot during a time-out. We also added a new Tcl command
      &#39;dnslookup&#39;, so scripts can look up IP&#39;s and hostname now
      asynchronously, too.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>+/-nodesynch</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This new channel setting replaces the old &#39;allow-desync&#39;
      setting from global to channel functionality. This setting is useful if
      you use some kind of chanserv or if you don&#39;t care about your
      channel being desynch.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Nick length</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>To support longer nicknames as some IRC servers do (dalnet I think)
      a settings was added for this one (nick-len).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Penalty calculation</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eggdrop calculates penalty points on IRCNET now, so it won&#39;t
      flood itself off anymore.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Share module</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Share module has a new setting (override-bots) which allows hub bots
      to override the leafs bot setting (botadress, telnet port and
      password). Please note, that this won&#39;t work with a 1.4 or even 1.3
      bot.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Tcl commands</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>All three commands to add stuff to the queues (puthelp, putserv
        and putquick) support the &#39;-next&#39; parameter now which pushes
        data to the front of the queues.</li>

        <li>A command to calculate md5 checksums was added (md5).</li>

        <li>To support the new asynch dns module, the command
        &#39;dnslookup&#39; was added.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Traffic accounting</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eggdrop counts the whole traffic which it generates and receives
      through IRC, botnet and dcc now. You can access these statistics via
      the dcc command &#39;.traffic&#39;. Please note, that the counter gets
      reset every time a restart is done.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Transfer / Filesys modules</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The filesys and transfer modules have changed completely. Both can
      handle now unlimited filename lengths and description sizes. Incomplete
      downloads from the bot can be resumed now.<br>
       The db format of the filesys module was also changed to remove the
      limits imposed by the old format. There&#39;s nothing special for you
      to do as the old db is automatically converted to the new format when
      you first access it. You won&#39;t be able to downgrade to older
      versions after this though, so maybe you&#39;ll want to make a backup
      first.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Changes made to Eggdrop 1.4.xx from Eggdrop1.3.xx</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Sharing</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Sharing has changed a little. You will notice that a resync buffer
      is kept for share bots when they disconnect. This allows for them not
      to have to send the entire userfile again when they reconnect. This is
      a much more efficient approach to syncing the user files.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Botflags</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Bot flags have changed. It is recommended that you read the BOTNET
      document to learn more about linking bots. Major changes in how you
      configure a passive and aggressive bot.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Userflags</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>User flags have changed. You still have the basic flags but others
      have been added. Some changes to this are that if someone has a global
      +n they will automatically be given all the global flags available. You
      will also notice there are no more capital letters; each flag has its
      own unique letter. An example is the B flag, in previous versions, it
      stood for a botnet master. The new flag is t. For more information on
      these changes, see the .help whois for a list of all flags. 1.3.24
      introduces a new flag (+w) for +stopnethack procedure flexibility.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Languages</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Almost everything the bot says now is in language file. This should
      allow the bot to be more versatile for other people that do not speak
      English. As soon as we start getting the translations in there will be
      a directory on ftp.eggheads.org that will contain ready to use language
      files. Look for it real soon.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Commands</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>.voice</em> and <em> .devoice</em> commands where added in dcc
      chat. This will voice a user on a channel if the bot is oped. Likewise
      for the .devoice command.</p>
