    <p>This is the quick install guide; if you have had little or no
    experience with UNIX or Eggdrop, READ THE <a href="readme.html">README</a>
    FILE NOW! This file is only for experienced users.</p>

    <p>For more information on compiling Eggdrop, see the
    <a href="compiling.html">Compile Guide</a> (and of course, the

    <p><a name="sect1"></a>1. <strong>What is Eggdrop?</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Please, read the <a href="readme.html">Readme</a> file before
      attempting to set up this bot. It is <strong>NOT</strong> easy to
      use! This file is a quick setup guide, not a miracle worker. If you
      enter this file without basic Eggdrop knowledge, you will
      <strong>NOT</strong> leave with a working bot! Before asking ANY
      questions, <strong>READ THE <a href="readme.html">README</a> FILE OR
      YOU WILL BE BURNED TO A HORRIBLE DEATH! IF YOU DO NOT READ THAT FILE
      I WILL PERSONALLY WALK TO YOUR TERMINAL AND BEAT IT WITH A SMELLY
      SNEAKER!</strong> By the way, read the <a href="readme.html">README</a>
      file.</p>

    <p><a name="sect2"></a>2. <strong>Quick startup</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eggdrop uses the GNU autoconfigure scripts to make things easier.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Type &#39;./configure&#39; from the Eggdrop directory. The
          configure script will determine how your system is set up and
          figure out how to correctly compile Eggdrop. It will also try
          to find Tcl, which is required to compile.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Type either &#39;make config&#39; or &#39;make iconfig&#39; to
          determine which modules will be compiled. &#39;make config&#39;
          compiles the default modules (everything but woobie.mod). If you
          want to choose which modules to compile, use &#39;make iconfig&#39;.
       </li>

       <li>
          <p>Type &#39;make&#39; from the eggdrop directory, or to force a
          statically linked module bot, type &#39;make static&#39;. Otherwise,
          the Makefile will compile whatever type of bot the configure script
          determined your system will support. Dynamic is always the better
          way to go if possible. There are also the &#39;debug&#39; and
          &#39;sdebug&#39; (static-debug) options, which will give more
          detailed output on a (highly unlikely :) crash. This will help
          the devlopment team track down the crash and fix the bug. Debug and
          sdebug will take a little longer to compile and will enlarge the
          binary a bit, but it&#39;s worth it if you want to support Eggdrop
          development.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Eggdrop must be installed in a directory somewhere. This is
          accomplished by entering the Unix command:</p>
        </li>

        <blockquote>
          <p>make install</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This will install the Eggdrop in your home directory in a
        directory called &#39;eggdrop&#39; (i.e. /home/user/eggdrop).</p>

       <p>If you want to install to a different directory, use:</p>

       <blockquote>
          <p>make install DEST=&lt;directory&gt;</p>
       </blockquote>

       <p>For example:</p>

       <blockquote>
         <p>make install DEST=/home/user/otherdir</p>
       </blockquote>

       <p>Note that you must use full path for every file to be correctly
       installed.</p>

       <p>[The following is performed from the directory installed above.]</p>

        <li>
          <p>Edit your config file completely.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Start the bot with the &quot;-m&quot; option to create a user
          file, i.e. &#39;./eggdrop -m LamestBot.conf&#39;.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>When starting the bot in the future, drop the &quot;-m&quot;.
          If you have edited your config file correctly, you can type:

          <blockquote>
            <p>chmod u+x &lt;my-config-file-name&gt;</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>For example:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>chmod u+x LamestBot.conf</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>From then on, you will be able to use your config file as a
          shell script. You can just type &quot;./LamestBot.conf&quot; from
          your shell prompt to start up your bot. For this to work, the top
          line of your script MUST contain the correct path to the Eggdrop
          executable.</p>
        </li>

        <li><p>It&#39;s advisable to run your bot via crontab, so that it will
        automatically restart if the machine goes down or (heaven forbid) the
        bot should crash. Look at &#39;scripts/botchk&#39; and
        &#39;scripts/autobotchk&#39; for a great start with crontabbing the
        bot.</p></li>

        <li><p>Smile, and if you haven&#39;t already read the README file
        in its entirety, go take a long walk off a short pier.</p></li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect3"></a>3. <strong>Modules</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <p>Modules are small pieces of code that can either be compiled into
        the binary or can be compiled separately into a file. This allows
        for a much smaller binary.</p>

        <p>If there are any modules that you have made or downloaded, you
        can add them to the bot by placing them in the /src/mod directory
        with a mod extension. They will be automatically compiled during
        make for you. They must have a valid Makefile and, of course, be
        compatible with the rest of the Eggdrop source.</p>

        <p>If you wish to add a module at a later time, follow the same steps
        in paragraph 2. After you have moved the appropriate files, you will
        only need to type &#39;make modules&#39; to compile only the modules
        portion of the bot.</p>
      </ol>

    <p><a name="sect4"></a>4. <strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>What do I do if...?</p>

      <p><strong>READ THE <a href="readme.html">README</a> FILE!</strong></p>

      <p>The readme does not answer...!</p>

      <p><strong>READ THE <a href="readme.html">README</a> FILE
      AGAIN!</strong></p>

      <p>I still don&#39;t know how to...</p>

      <p><strong>MEMORIZE THE <a href="readme.html">README</a>
      FILE!</strong></p>

      <p>But...</p>

      <p>Well, go to <a href="http://www.egghelp.org/">www.egghelp.org</a>
      or <a href="http://www.eggheads.org/">www.eggheads.org</a> and see if
      you can find there what you&#39;re looking for. There are also lots
      of IRC help channels and various mailing lists, as seen in the
      <strong><a href="readme.html">README</a> FILE</strong>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This is the end. If you read to this point, hopefully you have also
    read the <a href="readme.html">README</a> file. If not, then READ
    IT!&@#%@!</p>

    <p>Have fun with Eggdrop!</p>
