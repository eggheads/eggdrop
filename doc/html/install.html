    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Please, read the file <A href= 
      "readme.html">README</A> before attempting to set up this bot. It is
      <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> easy to use! This file is a quick setup guide, not
      a miracle worker. If you enter this file without basic Eggdrop
      knowledge, you will <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> leave with a working bot!
      Before asking ANY questions, <STRONG>READ THE README FILE OR YOU WILL
      BE BURNED TO A HORRIBLE DEATH! IF YOU DO NOT READ THAT FILE I WILL
      PERSONALLY WALK TO YOUR TERMINAL AND BEAT IT WITH A SMELLY
      SNEAKER!</STRONG> By the way, read <A href="readme.html">

      <LI>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Type &#39;./configure&#39;
        from the Eggdrop directory.&nbsp; That script will determine how your
        system is set up, and figure out how to compile Eggdrop.&nbsp; It
        will also try to find Tcl, which is required to compile.</FONT></P>

      <LI>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Type &#39;make&#39; from
        the Eggdrop directory.&nbsp; Or to force a statically linked module
        bot type &#39;make static&#39;.&nbsp; Otherwise the Makefile will
        determine which type of bot your system will support.&nbsp; Dynamic
        is always the better way to go if possible. There are also the
        options debug and sdebug (static-debug) which will give more detailed
        output on (a highly unlikely :) crash. This might help the devteam to
        track down the crash and fix the bug. Debug and sdebug will take a
        little longer to compile and will enlarge the binary a bit, but
        it&#39;s worth if you want to support Eggdrop development.</FONT></P>

      <LI>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Copy the file
        &#39;eggdrop.conf.dist&#39; to a new file, usually the same name as
        the bot that will use it, e.g. &quot;Lamestbot&quot;.</FONT></P>

        your bot.&nbsp; For this to work, the top line of your script MUST
        contain the correct path to the eggdrop binary.</FONT></P>

      <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">It&#39;s advisable to run
      your bot via crontab so that it will automatically restart if the
      machine goes down or (heaven forbid) the bot should crash. Look at the
      file &#39;scripts/botchk&#39; and &#39;scripts/autobotchk&#39; for a
      great start with crontabbing the bot.</FONT></LI>

    MODULES</FONT></STRONG> 

    <OL>
      <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Modules are small pieces of
      code that can either be compiled into the binary or can be compiled
      separately in a file.&nbsp; This allows for a much smaller binary and a
      way of choosing which options you want installed in the bot.&nbsp;
      Before you compile the bot you can remove any *.mod directory in the
      src/mod that you don&#39;t wish to be compiled.&nbsp; Use caution
      though most of the modules that come with Eggdrop are required.&nbsp;
      The exception is woobie.mod and seen.mod.&nbsp; If you do not want
      these modules it is safe to delete those directories.</FONT></LI>

      <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">If there are any personal
      modules that you have made or downloaded you can add them to the bot by
      placing them in the /src/mod directory with a mod extension.&nbsp; They
      will be automatically compiled during the make for you.&nbsp; They must
      have a valid make file and of course be compatible with the rest of the
      Eggdrop source.</FONT></LI>

      <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">If you wish to add a module
      at a latter time follow the same steps in paragraph 2.&nbsp; After you
      have moved the appropriate files you will only need to type make
      modules to compile only the modules portion of the bot.</FONT></LI>
