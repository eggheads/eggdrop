      <p><strong>About Eggdrop</strong></p>
    </div>
    <hr>

    <p>Eggdrop was created around December 1993 to help stop the incessant
    wars on #gayteen. It spawned from another bot that was in the process of
    being written at the time called &quot;Unrest&quot;. The purpose of
    Unrest was to answer help requests from other bots. The first public
    release was v0.6, and since then, it has grown into what you have before
    you.</p>

    <p>To use Eggdrop, you need:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>some sort of Unix account -- it does not compile for Windows or
        Mac machines, nor will it probably ever compile there</li>

        <li>pretty good knowledge of IRC and Unix, including how to compile
        programs and what DCC chat is, at absolute minimum</li>

        <li>about 500k of disk space, or more, depending on your system (on
        Linux, the executable itself takes up about 200k currently -- it will
        be a lot larger on a RISC system)</li>

        <li>the Tcl libraries -- if you don&#39;t have them (and most systems
        should), check the README file on info about how to install it
        yourself (you don&#39;t need to be root)</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Before starting, ask yourself if you really need a bot. Most IRC
    servers allow only a handful of bots -- some forbid them outright. The
    reason? Too many people run bots as &quot;toys&quot; or as a means of
    destruction. If you want to use Eggdrop for destructive purposes, go
    ahead and erase this directory now. It&#39;s almost impossible to do what
    you want with this bot.</p>

    <p>You should try to find at least one server that will allow you to run
    a bot. If you use an ISP (Internet Service Provider) that runs its own
    IRC server, check to make sure that bots are okay. If you&#39;re going to
    use a server somewhere else, read the MOTD (message of the day) and find
    out what their bot policy is. Following the rules will go a long way
    toward making your bot accepted.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, you only need a bot on EFnet if your channel has a
    constant supply of users (24 hours a day) and no bot. If your channel
    already has a couple of bots on it, it probably doesn&#39;t need any
    more. More bots don&#39;t do any more good, and waste bandwidth. On the
    Undernet you will probably never need more than one bot per channel. Also
    note that it&#39;s generally not acceptable to use a bot to &quot;keep a
    channel open&quot; when it&#39;s not in use. However, policies differ
    from net to net and server to server so check around before starting.</p>

    <p>Bots <strong>CANNOT</strong> provide absolute protection. Nothing can.
    Eggdrop will try its hardest but there are no guarantees.</p>
