    <p><a name="sect1"></a>1.<strong> What do I do if I get the error
    &quot;User file not found&quot;?</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Run Eggdrop with the &quot;-m&quot; option (i.e. &quot;eggdrop
        -m eggdrop.conf&quot;).</li>

        <li>Go to IRC and send &quot;hello&quot; to your bot (i.e.
        &quot;/msg mybot hello&quot;).</li>

        <li>You will become an owner on your bot. You can leave the bot
        running (nobody else will become an owner if they say
        &quot;hello&quot;), but in the future, don&#39;t use the
        &quot;-m&quot; option when running the bot.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect2"></a>2. <strong>My Eggdrop won&#39;t run; it just says
    &quot;can&#39;t find your hostname!&quot;</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      Your machine is set up strangely, and Eggdrop can&#39;t figure out its
      network hostname. You can get around this by setting the my-ip setting
      in the config file correctly.
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect3"></a>3. <strong>What the heck is Tcl?</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Tcl is a scripting language written by John Ousterhout. It&#39;s
      much better than most &quot;built-in&quot; script languages (like the
      one in ircII) and is meant to be linked with anything needing a
      scripting language, so I linked it with Eggdrop.
      <a href="tcl-commands.html">Eggdrop Tcl Commands</a> contains a list of
      additional Tcl commands provided by Eggdrop. There are also several
      example scripts in the scripts/ directory, and one in the doc directory
      called first_script.txt. There are also hundreds of scripts floating
      around on the ftp/web sites if you like working by example (which is
      typically the best way).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect4"></a>4. <strong>My bot dies and the last entry in the
    logfile is &quot;received terminate signal&quot;. What does that mean and
    can i prevent it?</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>There&#39;s nothing you can do to prevent it. It means the system
      administrator is killing the Eggdrop process. Most of the time,
      it&#39;s an automatic thing that happens when the system is being
      rebooted, so it&#39;s harmless. If you have a crontab running, the bot
      will get restarted when the system is back online. Occasionally, the
      system administrator will kill the bot manually. For example, if
      he/she doesn&#39;t want bots running on the system.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect5"></a>5. <strong>Someone else set up a bot I don&#39;t
    like. Are there any backdoors I can use to take their bot down?</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>No, there have never been any backdoors and there never will be, so
      please stop asking. Every once in a while, someone finds a way to
      exploit a bug in Eggdrop, but we fix these bugs as soon as we find out
      about them. If you want to bring down someone else&#39;s bot, you will
      not have my/our help.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect6"></a>6. <strong>What are modules?</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Modules are a way of adding extra features to the bot, much like Tcl
      scripts, without requiring the bot to be recompiled. See doc/MODULES for
      more info.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect7"></a>7. <strong>Can I compile Eggdrop without dynamic
    modules?</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Yes, you can. If the configure script detects that your system
      CAN&#39;T run modules, it will setup &#39;make&#39; to link the
      modules in statically for you. You can choose this option yourself by
      using &#39;make static&#39;. You can also try to compile dynamic
      modules on a static-only system by using &#39;make eggdrop&#39;.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect7a"></a>7a. <strong>Do I still need to &#39;loadmodule&#39;
    modules?</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>YES, when you compile statically, all the modules are linked into
      the main executable. HOWEVER, they are not enabled until you use
      loadmodule to enable them, hence you get nearly the same functionality
      with static modules as with dynamic modules.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect8"></a>8. <strong>Where can i get a pre-compiled Eggdrop
    for my computer?</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>It is <strong>HIGHLY</strong> recommended <strong>AGAINST</strong>
      using pre-compiled Eggdrops from un-trusted sources. Eggdrop has been a
      regular target for hacking and crashing. Distribution of pre-compiled
      (binary) versions of Eggdrop are the easiest way for hackers to provide
      you with the easiest (and most dangerous) way of gaining access to, not
      only your bot, but to your computer account directly. Don&#39;t
      advertise your pre-compiled Eggdrop binary sites on the Eggdrop list
      either. =P</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect9"></a>9. <strong>I get &#39;Makefile:3 :invalid
    operator&#39; or some-such-thing when I try to &#39;make&#39;.</strong>
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Try &#39;gmake&#39;.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect10"></a>10. <strong>When I &#39;tclsh scripts/weed
    &lt;userfile&gt; c&#39; it barfs chunks at me and dies. :(</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Upgrade your Tcl, you are probably using Tcl 7.5 or earlier. Some
      of the commands in weed require Tcl7.6 to run, so either upgrade it or
      remove the offending lines from you userfile manually (those starting
      with &#39;.&#39; generally) and accept the loss of that data.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect11"></a>11. <strong>I get &quot;ld-elf.so.1: Shared
    object &quot;libtcl80.so.1&quot; not found&quot; or &quot;eggdrop: error
    in loading shared libraries / libtcl8.1.so: cannot open shared object
    file: No such file or directory&quot; when I try to start my bot.
     </strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&#39;./configure&#39; is looking in the wrong place for Tcl; it
      looks like it compiled with one version of Tcl and tries to load
      another. Maybe your sysadmin upgraded Tcl and didn&#39;t tell you. In
      that case, you should just need to recompile your bot.</p>

      <p>Maybe, when upgrading, he didn&#39;t clean the old version of Tcl,
      and &#39;./configure&#39; is looking for the files in the wrong places,
      or trying to use different versions of tcl.h and libtcl*. Smack your
      admin and have him install Tcl properly. ;) You can also try:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><em>./configure --with-tcllib=&lt;path-to-tcl-lib&gt;
        --with-tclinc=&lt;path-to-tcl-inc&gt;</em></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This will tell configure where to look for the Tcl files.</p>

      <p>Try looking for libtcl by:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>ls /usr/lib/libtcl*<br>
        ls /usr/local/lib/libtcl*</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Try looking for tcl.h by:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>ls /usr/include/*/tcl.h<br>
        ls /usr/local/include/*/tcl.h</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>If everything else fails, try to install Tcl to your home dir ;)
      (Suggested by dw@Undernet, dw@lixom.nu).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect12"></a>12. <strong>I get a whole pile of
    &quot;Unresolved symbol &#39;Tcl_AppendResult&#39;&quot; (or some other
    symbol) when I try to load a modules.</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Possibility A: See section 11.</p>

      <p>Possibility B: Some of the standard libraries have been compiled
      for static linking only on your machine, you have 3 options:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>If it&#39;s your own machine, recompile Tcl using dynamic
            linking by using &#39;./configure --enable-shared&#39; when you
            configure Tcl (not the bot) and then remake, &amp; reinstall.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If it&#39;s not your machine, you may have to resort to &#39;make
            static&#39; and &#39;make install DEST=&quot;path&quot;&#39; to make
            and install your bot.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If you are of a more aggressive sense of mind, go beat the
            stuffing out of your admin for having lame static libraries. :)</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
