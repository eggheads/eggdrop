PATCH HOW-TO


The purpose of this document is to show you what a patch is and how you
can create, apply, download, and submit a patch.

A patch is an update to the source code of a program (here Eggdrop). Be
careful, every patch is designed for a special Eggdrop version and
cannot be applied on every bot!


APPLYING A PATCH

  To apply a patch to an Eggdrop, you have to first obtain the Eggdrop
  source code. You should always keep a tar.gz archive with the source
  of your current Eggdrop on your shell. In the next step, you have to
  change to your source directory (i.e.: /home/user/eggdrop-1.9.0/) and
  type the following command:

      patch -p1 < ../path.to.the/patch

  Once this is complete, execute the following command:

    find . -name "*.rej" -print

  If it returns a list with filenames ending with .rej extension, then
  the patch didn't apply properly. Ensure that the patch is intended for
  your version and that you have the original source. You should also
  try to re-download the patch to ensure that the patch is not
  corrupted.

  If you get an error such as this:

      |Index: Makefile.in
      |===================================================================
      |RCS file: /usr/local/cvsroot/eggdrop1.8/Makefile.in,v
      |retrieving revision 1.38
      |diff -u -r1.38 Makefile.in
      |--- Makefile.in    17 Jun 2004 05:43:28 -0000  1.38
      |+++ Makefile.in    23 Jul 2004 21:58:23 -0000
      --------------------------
      File to patch:

  Then you should try using a different '-p' option. Try -p0 first, and
  then -p2, -p3, etc.

  If the patch applied properly, the only thing left to do is to
  recompile your Eggdrop and install the new modules and binaries.


CREATING AND SUBMITTING A PATCH (VIA GITHUB - PREFERRED!)

If you fixed a bug and/or changed something in Eggdrop's source code, it
would be really nice to let the dev team know about it, so we can
possibly apply it to next release of Eggdrop.

To create a patch via github:

  1.  Fork the eggdrop git repo by logging in to your GitHub account and
      clicking the fork button at the top of the screen. Follow the
      directions it provides to configure your local repo.
  2.  Enter the local directory and create a new branch for your patch:

          git checkout -b <DescriptiveBranchName>

  3.  Make your changes
  4.  Once you confirm your patch works, push the changes back to your
      GitHub repo - this is usually done by something similar to:

          git push origin <DescriptiveBranchName>

  5.  Create a pull request by clicking on the "Pull Request" button on
      your GitHub page. Select the appropriate branches (usually
      eggheads/eggdrop/develop and yourUserName/eggdrop/YourBranchName)
  6.  Fill in the Pull Request template and submit
  7.  Pour yourself a cold one and bask in the warm feeling of
      contributing to the open source community! Karma++!


CREATING AND SUBMITTING A PATCH (VIA DIFF - OLD SCHOOL!)

To create a patch using the diff tool:

  1.  Create a directory with original source tree and one with modified
      source tree.
  2.  Run the following:

          diff -urN eggdrop1.8.original eggdrop1.8.modified > patchname.patch

      DO NOT add any other diff options.

  3.  Send an e-mail to patches@eggheads.org with the patch attached.
      The body should contain a detailed description of what you changed
      and why you changed it. Don't forget to include the Eggdrop
      version for which your patch was created.

      It helps if you include the major release number that the patch is
      for in the subject line. For the 1.8.x series, the subject line
      should look like this:

          PATCH1.8: my-patch-filename.patch

      You should also include the nick/handle, name, and email address
      you would like used for attribution in the Changes1.9 and THANKS
      files.

  Never modify src/version.h or one of the Changes files. We will do it.
  If your patch includes changes related to autotools (./configure,
  etc), do NOT run autoconf, autoheader, etc; we will do this as well.

  Also, please don't add credit lines all over the source when patching.
  Patch contributors will receive credit in Changes1.9 and THANKS.

  Patches submitted this way for Eggdrop 1.9.x can be found at the
  following location:

    ftp://ftp.eggheads.org/pub/eggdrop/patches/1.9
