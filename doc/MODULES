Eggdrop Module Information Last revised: Jul 25, 2016



EGGDROP MODULE INFORMATION


The purpose of this document is to show you how to download, install,
create, and submit modules.


WHAT ARE MODULES?

Modules are portions of code which are loaded separately to the bot
itself and provide extra services. For example, the filesys module
provides the entire file system.


WHY USE MODULES?

Modules allow C coders to add their own enhancements to the bot while
keeping them optional and without increasing the size of the Eggdrop
core.


HOW TO INSTALL A MODULE

Please note that these are only basic instructions for compiling and
installing a module. Please read any and all directions included with
the module you wish to install.

  1.  Download and un-tar the Eggdrop source code.
  2.  Place the new module in its own directory (in the format of
      (modulename).mod) in src/mod.
  3.  Run ./configure (from eggdrop1.8.x/).
  4.  Type 'make config' or 'make iconfig'.
  5.  Type 'make'.
  6.  Copy the compiled module file (modulename.so) into your bot's
      modules folder.
  7.  Add 'loadmodule modulename' to your eggdrop.conf file (do not add
      the .so suffix).
  8.  Rehash or restart your bot.

To view your currently loaded modules, type '.module'.


MODULES INCLUDED WITH EGGDROP

  assoc

      This module provides assoc support, i.e. naming channels on the
      botnet.

  blowfish

      Eggdrop can encrypt your userfile, so users can have secure
      passwords. Please note that when you change your encryption method
      later (i.e. using other modules like a md5 module), you can't use
      your current userfile anymore. Eggdrop will not start without an
      encryption module.

  channels

      This module provides channel related support for the bot. Without
      it, you won't be able to make the bot join a channel or save
      channel specific userfile information.

  compress

      This module provides support for file compression. This allows the
      bot to transfer compressed user files and, therefore, save a
      significant amount of bandwidth.

  console

      This module provides storage of console settings when you exit the
      bot or type .store on the partyline.

  ctcp

      This module provides the normal ctcp replies that you'd expect.
      Without it loaded, CTCP CHAT will not work.

  dns

      This module provides asynchronous dns support. This will avoid
      long periods where the bot just hangs there, waiting for a
      hostname to resolve, which will often let it timeout on all other
      connections.

  filesys

      This module provides an area within the bot where users can store
      and manage files. With this module, the bot is usable as a file
      server.

  irc

      This module provides basic IRC support for your bot. You have to
      load this if you want your bot to come on IRC.

  notes

      This module provides support for storing of notes for users from
      each other. Note sending between currently online users is
      supported in the core, this is only for storing the notes for
      later retrieval.

  seen

      This module provides very basic seen commands via msg, on channel
      or via dcc. This module works only for users in the bot's
      userlist. If you are looking for a better and more advanced seen
      module, try the gseen module by G'Quann. You can find it at
      http://www.kreativrauschen.com/gseen.mod/.

  server

      This module provides the core server support. You have to load
      this if you want your bot to come on IRC. Not loading this is
      equivalent to the old NO_IRC define.

  share

      This module provides userfile sharing support between two directly
      linked bots.

  transfer

      The transfer module provides DCC SEND/GET support and userfile
      transfer support for userfile sharing.

  uptime

      This module reports uptime statistics to the uptime contest web
      site at http://uptime.eggheads.org. Go look and see what your
      uptime is! It takes about 9 hours to show up, so if your bot isn't
      listed, try again later. See doc/settings/mod.uptime for more
      information, including details on what information is sent to the
      uptime server.

  woobie

      This is for demonstrative purposes only. If you are looking for
      starting point in writing modules, woobie is the right thing.


PROGRAMMING MODULES

WARNING: This section is very likely to be out of date.

Note: This is for a simple module of 1 source file. If you're doing a
multiple source file module, you shouldn't need to read this anyway.

  1.  Create a src/mod/MODULE.mod directory in your Eggdrop directory
      (where MODULE is the module name) and cd to it.
  2.  Copy the file 'Makefile' from src/mod/woobie.mod and replace all
      occurrences of 'woobie' with your module name. This should ensure
      that your module gets compiled.
  3.  Next, you want to create a file called MODULE.c (MODULE is the
      module name again).
  4.  You MUST include the following in your source code:

          #define MODULE_NAME "module-name"

    This should be defined to the same name you will be using when you
    load your module.

        #define MAKING_MODULENAME

    MODULENAME is the name of your module (MODULE_NAME), but in all
    caps.

        #include "../module.h"

    This provides access to Eggdrop's global function table. Examine
    src/mod/module.h closely to find a list of functions available.

        #include any other standard c header files you might need. 

    Note that stdio.h, string.h, stdlib.h, and sys/types.h are already
    included.

        Function *global;

    This variable provides access to all the Eggdrop functions; without
    it, you can't call any Eggdrop functions (the module won't even
    load).


MODULE REQUIREMENTS

In most modules, all functions/variables (except global and
MODULE_start) should be static. This will drastically reduce the size of
modules on decent systems.

Throughout this step, MODULE refers to the module name. Note that

    "MODULE_NAME" should literally be "MODULE_NAME".

MODULE_start

    char *MODULE_start(Function *func_table)

    This function is called when the module is first loaded. There are
    several things that need to be done in this function

    global = func_table;

    This allows you to make calls to the global function table.

    module_register(MODULE_NAME, MODULE_table, MAJOR, MINOR);

    This records details about the module for other modules and Eggdrop
    itself to access. MAJOR and MINOR are ints, where MAJOR is the
    module's major version number and MINOR is a minor version number.
    MODULE_table is a function table (see below).

    module_depend(MODULE_NAME, "another-module", MAJOR, MINOR);

    This lets Eggdrop know that your module NEEDS "another-module" of
    major version 'MAJOR' and at least minor version 'MINOR' to run,
    and hence should try to load it if it's not already loaded. This
    will return 1 on success, or 0 if it can't be done (at which stage
    you should return an error).

Any other initialization stuff you desire should also be included in
this function. See below for various things you can do.

You also will need to return a value. Returning NULL implies the module
loaded successfully. Returning a non-NULL STRING is an error message.
The module (and any other dependent modules) will stop loading and an
error will be returned.

MODULE_table

    static Function *MODULE_table = {
           MODULE_start,
           MODULE_close,
           MODULE_expmem,
           MODULE_report,
           any_other_functions,
           you_want_to_export
    };

    This is a table of functions which any other module can access. The
    first 4 functions are FIXED. You MUST have them; they provide important
    module information.

MODULE_close ()

    static char *MODULE_close ()

    This is called when the module is unloaded. Apart from tidying any
    relevant data (I suggest you be thorough, we don't want any trailing
    garbage from modules), you MUST do the following:

    module_undepend(MODULE_NAME);

    This lets Eggdrop know your module no longer depends on any other
    modules.

    Return a value. NULL implies success; any non-NULL STRING implies
    that the module cannot be unloaded for some reason, and hence the
    bot should not unload it (see the blowfish module for an example).

MODULE_expmem

    static int MODULE_expmem ()

    This should tally all memory you allocate/deallocate within the module
    (using nmalloc, nfree, etc) in bytes. It's used by memory debugging to
    track memory faults, and it is used by .status to total up memory usage.

MODULE_report

    static void MODULE_report (int idx)

    This should provide a relatively short report of the module's status
    (for the module and status commands).

These functions are available to modules. MANY more available functions
can be found in src/mod/module.h.

Additional functions

    void *nmalloc(int j);

    This allocates j bytes of memory.

    void nfree(void *a);

    This frees an nmalloc'd block of memory.

    Context;

    Actually a macro -- records the current position in execution (for
    debugging). Using Context is no longer recommended, because it uses
    too many resources and a core file provides much more information.

    void dprintf(int idx, char *format, ...)

    This acts like a normal printf() function, but it outputs to
    log/socket/idx.

    idx is a normal dcc idx, or if < 0 is a sock number.

    Other destinations:
      DP_LOG    - send to log file
      DP_STDOUT - send to stdout
      DP_MODE   - send via mode queue to the server
      DP_SERVER - send via normal queue to the server
      DP_HELP   - send via help queue to server

    const module_entry *module_find(char *module_name, int major, int minor);

      Searches for a loaded module (matching major, >= minor), and returns
      info about it.

      Members of module_entry:
        char *name;      - module name
        int major;       - real major version
        int minor;       - real minor version
        Function *funcs; - function table (see above)

    void module_rename(char *old_module_name, char *new_module_name)

      This renames a module frim old_module_name to new_module_name.

    void add_hook(int hook_num, Function *funcs)
    void del_hook(int hook_num, Function *funcs)

     These are used for adding or removing hooks to/from Eggdrop code that
     are triggered on various events. Valid hooks are:
       HOOK_SECONDLY   - called every second
       HOOK_MINUTELY   - called every minute
       HOOK_5MINUTELY  - called every 5 minutes
       HOOK_HOURLY     - called every hour (hourly-updates minutes past)
       HOOK_DAILY      - called when the logfiles are switched

       HOOK_READ_USERFILE - called when the userfile is read
       HOOK_USERFILE      - called when the userfile is written
       HOOK_PRE_REHASH    - called just before a rehash
       HOOK_REHASH        - called just after a rehash
       HOOK_IDLE          - called whenever the dcc connections have been
                            idle for a whole second
       HOOK_BACKUP        - called when a user/channel file backup is done
       HOOK_LOADED        - called when Eggdrop is first loaded
       HOOK_DIE           - called when Eggdrop is about to die

    char *module_unload (char *module_name);
    char *module_load (char *module_name);

      Tries to load or unload the specified module; returns 0 on success, or
      an error message.

    void add_tcl_commands(tcl_cmds *tab);
    void rem_tcl_commands(tcl_cmds *tab);

      Provides a quick way to create and remove a table of Tcl commands. The
      table is in the form of:

        {char *func_name, Function *function_to_call}

      Use { NULL, NULL } to indicate the end of the list.

    void add_tcl_ints(tcl_ints *);
    void rem_tcl_ints(tcl_ints *);

      Provides a quick way to create and remove a table of links from C
      int variables to Tcl variables (add_tcl_ints checks to see if the Tcl
      variable exists and copies it over the C one). The format of table is:

        {char *variable_name, int *variable, int readonly}

      Use {NULL, NULL, 0} to indicate the end of the list.

    void add_tcl_strings(tcl_strings *);
    void rem_tcl_strings(tcl_strings *);

      Provides a quick way to create and remove a table of links from C
      string variables to Tcl variables (add_tcl_ints checks to see if the
      Tcl variable exists and copies it over the C one). The format of table
      is:

        {char *variable_name, char *string, int length, int flags}

      Use {NULL, NULL, 0, 0} to indicate the end of the list. Use 0 for
      length if you want a const string. Use STR_DIR for flags if you want a
      '/' constantly appended; use STR_PROTECT if you want the variable set
      in the config file, but not during normal usage.

    void add_builtins(p_tcl_hash_list table, cmd_t *cc);
    void rem_builtins(p_tcl_hash_list table, cmd_t *cc);

      This adds binds to one of Eggdrop's bind tables. The format of the
      table is:

        {char *command, char *flags, Function *function, char *displayname}

      Use {NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL} to indicate the end of the list.

      This works EXACTLY like the Tcl 'bind' command. displayname is what Tcl
      sees this function's proc name as (in .binds all).

      function is called with exactly the same args as a Tcl binding is with
      type conversion taken into account (e.g. idx's are ints). Return values
      are much the same as Tcl bindings. Use int 0/1 for those which require
      0/1, or char * for those which require a string (auch as filt). Return
      nothing if no return value is required.

    void putlog (int logmode, char *channel, char *format, ...)

      Adds text to a logfile (determined by logmode and channel). This text
      will also output to any users' consoles if they have the specified
      console mode enabled.


WHAT TO DO WITH A MODULE?

  If you have written a module and feel that you wish to share it with
  the rest of the Eggdrop community, upload it to the incoming directory
  on incoming.eggheads.org (/incoming/modules/1.8). Place a nice
  descriptive text (modulename.desc) with it, and it'll make its way to
  the modules directory on ftp.eggheads.org. Don't forget to mention in
  your text file which version Eggdrop the module is written for.
