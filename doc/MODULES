VI    WHAT TO DO WITH A MODULE?


I.    WHAT ARE MODULES?

Modules are portions of code which are loaded seperately to the
bot itself, which provided extra services. eg. filesys module
provides the entire file system.


II.   WHY USE MODULES?

It allows the core eggdrop, that which is minimally required to be
reduced, and allows C coders to add their own ehancements to the
bot without recompiling the whole thing.


III.  HOW TO USE MODULES

Run ./configure as normal, then 'make' to make the eggdrop
with module support, this will also compile the modules.

The list of modules compiled is adjustable by

 (a) specifying `--disable-mod-MODULE' parameters to the configure
     script, where MODULE is the module you want to disable.

 (b) the interactive module selection tool called during a normal
     ./configure run. (this may be disabled by specifying the
     parameter `--disable-modconf')

 (c) calling `make reconfig' after a successful configure run,
     which calls the interactive module selection tool again.

Next do one of two things to load the module:

   from the partyline (as an owner) type:
      .loadmod <module-name>
   or in a tcl script:
      loadmodule <module-name>

   module-name is the part BEFORE .so, e.g filesys.so module
   you type '.loadmod filesys'.

Normally you will want to add the loadmodule statement to your
bot's configuration file instead of typing it every time the bot
start.

To see your currently running modules type '.module'.


IV.   CURRENT MODULES

assoc       : Assoc support.
blowfish    : Encryption support needed for encrypting your users' passwords.
              Also needed for the wire module below. This module can't be
              unloaded once it's loaded.
channels    : Provides channel related support for the bot, without it, it
              will just sit on irc, it can respond to msg & ctcp commands,
              but that's all.
compress    : This module provides an zlib support for compress transfer of
              files via the botnet. For Example, compressed userfile transfers
              are possible now.
console     : This module provides storage of console settings when you exit
              the bot (or .store).
ctcp        : This provides the normal ctcp replies that you'd expect.
dns         : This module provides asynchronous dns support which avoids
              blocking on dns lookups. Especially useful for busy hub bots.
filesys     : The file system. If you unload it all users currently using
              the it will be disconnected from the bot.
irc         : This module provides ALL NORMAL IRC INTERACTION, if you want
              the normal join & maintain channels stuff, this is the module.
notes       : This provides support for storing of notes for users from each
              other. Notes between currently online users is supported in
              the core, this is only for storing the notes for later
              retrieval, direct user->user notes are built-in.
seen        : This module provides seen commands via msg, on channel or via
              dcc, similar to the various scripts.
server      : This provides the core server support (removing this is
              equivalent to the old NO_IRC define).
share       : Userfile sharing.
transfer    : Handles the transfer of files via botnet or dcc, this is
              REQUIRED for file sharing.
wire        : An encrypted partyline communication.
woobie      : Just a fun, bizarre test module which serves as an example for
              module programming.


V.    PROGRAMMING MODULES

WARNING:
      This section is very likely to be out of date. It was not updated
      for quite some time.  The most reliable way to learn about module
      programming is to take a deep look at the other available modules.

Note: This is for a simple module of 1 source file, if you're doing a
      multiple source file module, you shouldn't need to read this
      anyway ;)

(a) Create a src/mod/MODULE.mod directory in your eggdrop distro
    (where MODULE is the module name) and cd to it.

(b) Copy the file `Makefile' from src/mod/woobie.mod and replace all
    occurences of `woobie' with your module name. This should ensure
    that your module gets compiled.

(c) Next you want to create a file called MODULE.c (again MODULE is the
    module name), and here's where the work starts :)

   (1) Things you need to include in your source code.

       (i)   #define MODULE_NAME "module-name"

           You MUST use this, it's required by several short cuts in the
           code, it's gotta be the name you will be using in .loadmod

       (ii)  #define MAKING_MODULENAME
           You MUST also include this, or else the module won't work.
           MODULENAME is the name of your module(MODULE_NAME), but in
           caps

       (iii)  #include "../module.h"

           This provides all the accessible functions in eggdrop,
           examine closely src/mod/module.h to find a list of functions
           available.

       (iv) and other standard c include files you might need (Note
             stdio.h string.h stdlib.h & sys/types.h are already included)

       (v)  Function *global;

           This variable provides access to all the eggdrop functions, without
           it you can't call any eggdrop functions (heck, the module wont
           even load)

   (2) CORE functions every module needs.

*SIDENOTE* I suggest in a single source file module you define all
functions/variables (except global & module_start) as static, this will
drastically reduce the size of modules on decent systems.

       In each of these cases MODULE = module name

       (i) char *MODULE_start(Function *func_table)
           - this module is called when the module is first loaded,
           you MUST do serveral things in this function
           (a) global = func_table;  (so you can make eggdrop calls)
           (b) module_register(MODULE_NAME, MODULE_table, major, minor);
               this records details about the module for other modules
               & eggdrop itself to access, major is a major version number,
               minor is a minor version number, MODULE_table is a function
               table (see below)
           (c) module_depend(MODULE_NAME, "another-module", major, minor);
               this lets eggdrop know that your module NEEDS "another-module"
               of major version 'major' and at least minor version 'minor'
               to run and hence should try to load it if it's not already here
               this will return 1 on success, or 0 if it cant be done
               (at which stage you should return an error)
           (d) any other initialization stuff you desire, see below for
               various things you can do.
           (e) a return value of some sort, returning NULL implies the module
               loaded successfully, and so the bot can continue.
               return a non-NULL STRING is an error message, the module
               (and any other dependant modules) will stop loading
               and an error will be returned.

       (ii) static Function *MODULE_table = {
                MODULE_start,
                MODULE_close,
                MODULE_expmem,
                MODULE_report,
                any_other_functions,
                you_want_to_export
            };
            ok, it's not a function, it's a list of functions, which any
            other module can call up, so you can provide services for other
            modules (eg transfer has raw_dcc_send in it's table to allow
            the filesys to send files to others)
            the first 4 functions are FIXED, you MUST have them, they
            provide important system info.

       (iii) static char *MODULE_close ()
            - this is called when the module is unloaded..
            apart from tidying any relevant data (I suggest you be thorough,
            we don't want any trailing garbage from modules) you MUST do the
            following:
            (a) module_undepend(MODULE_NAME);
                this lets eggdrop know your module no longer depends on
                any other modules.
            (b) return a value, NULL implies success, non-NULL STRING implies
                the module cannot be unloaded for some reason and hence
                the bot should leave it in (see blowfish for an example)

       (iv) static int MODULE_expmem ()
            this should tally all memory you allocate/deallocate within
            the module (using modmalloc & modfree), it's used by memory
            debugging to track memory faults, and by .status to total up
            memory usage.

       (v) static void MODULE_report (int idx)
            this should provide a relatively short report of module status
            (for .module/.status)

   (c) AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS - this is what ppl want no? :)
       (i) reliable ones, you can RELY on these functions being available,
           they may move in the tables for the moment (since it's a work
           in progress) but they will be there...
           This is just a short list of the ones you need to make
           a mildly useful module, a goodly portion of the remaining
           eggdrop functions are avaliable, check src/mod/module.h for
           info.

void *nmalloc (int a);      - allocates a bytes
void   nfree (void *a);     - frees a modmalloc'd block
       context;             - actually a #define, records the current
                            - possition in execution, for debugging
void   dprintf (int idx,char *format, ... ) - just like normal printf,
                            outputs to a dcc/socket/server,
                            idx is a normal dcc idx OR if < 0 is a sock #
                            OR one of: DP_LOG (send to log file)
                            DP_STDOUT (send to stdout)
                            DP_MODE   (send via mode queue to sever) *fast*
                            DP_SERVER (send via normal queue to sever) *normal*
                            DP_HELP   (send via help queue to sever) - use this
                                      for mass outputs to users

int    module_register ( char *module_name,
                         Function *function_table,
                         int major, int minor )
              - see above for what/who/why/etc
const module_entry *module_find ( char *module_name, int major, int minor);
              - look for a module, (matching major, >= minor) and return
                info about it....members of module_entry...
                   char *name; - module name (duh)
                   int major;   - real major version
                   int minor;   - real minor version
                   Function *funcs; - function table (see above)

int    module_depend ( char *module_name, char *needed_module,
                       int major, int minor )
              - marks your module (module_name) as needing needed_module
                (matching major, >= minor) and tries to load said module
                if it's not already loaded. returns 1 on success
int    module_undepend ( char *module_name)
              - marks your module as no longer needing any of it's
                dependancies
void   module_rename (char *old_module_name, char *new_module_name)
              - renames a module, this works so that for exmaple, you
                could have efnet.so, undernet.so, ircnet.so & dalnet.so
                and they called all rename themselves as server.so which
                is what you really want

void add_hook (int hook_num, Function *funcs)
void del_hook (int hook_num, Function *funcs)

used for adding removing hooks into eggdrop code, on various events, these
functions are called, depending on the hook

valid hooks:

HOOK_SECONDLY      - called every second
HOOK_MINUTELY      - called every minute
HOOK_5MINUTELY     - called every 5 minutes
HOOK_HOURLY        - called every hour, (at hourly-updates minutes past)
HOOK_DAILY         - called every day, when the logfiles are switched
HOOK_READ_USERFILE - called when the userfile is read
HOOK_USERFILE      - called when the userfile is written
HOOK_PRE_REHASH    - called just *before* rehash
HOOK_REHASH        - called just after rehash
HOOK_IDLE          - called whenever the dcc connections have been idle
                     for a whole second

char *module_load ( char *module_name );  tries to load the given module,
   returns 0 on success, or an error msg

char *module_unload ( char *module_name );  tries to unload the given module,
   returns as above.

void add_tcl_commands(tcl_cmds *tab);
void rem_tcl_commands(tcl_cmds *tab);
   provides a quick way to load & unload a list of tcl commands, the
   table is in the form :
      { char *func_name, Function *function_to_call }
   these are normal tcl commands (as done in tcl*.c)
   use { 0, 0 } to indicate the end of the list

void add_tcl_ints(tcl_ints *);
void rem_tcl_ints(tcl_ints *);
   provides a way to add/remove links from c variables to tcl variables
   (add checks to see if the tcl already exists and copies it over the C one)
   format of table is :
      { char *variable_name, int *variable, int readonly }
   terminate with {0,0,0};

void add_tcl_strings(tcl_strings *);
void rem_tcl_strings(tcl_strings *);
   provides a way to add/remove links from c strings to tcl strings
   (also copies exists tcl values)
   format:
      { char * variable_name, char *string, int length, int flags }
   terminate with { 0, 0, 0, 0 }
   length: set to 0 if you want a const string.
   flags:  use STR_DIR if you want a / constantly appended,
           use STR_PROTECT if you want the variable on set in the configfile,
           not during normal usage.

void putlog (int logmode, char *channel, char *format, ... )
   logs a comment, see src/eggdrop.h for logmodes, channel makes
   a channel or "*" for all.

void add_builtins (p_tcl_hash_list table, cmd_t *cc);
void rem_builtins (p_tcl_hash_list table, cmd_t *cc);
   the method of adding/remove bindings for tcl hash tables.
   table is a hash table you find with find_hash_table,
   cc format:
   { char *command, char *flags, Function *function }
   terminate with { 0, 0, 0, 0 }
   this is EXACTLY like a bind command in tcl, (heck, tcl_bind calls
   the same function this does),
   function is called with exactly the same args as a tcl binding is
   (except for dcc which does include the handle in C) with type conversion
   taken into account (e.g. idx's are ints)
   return much the same as tcl bindings, use int 0/1 for those
   which require 0/1 or char * for those which require a string (eg filt)
   or nothing if no return is required.
   return is also in src/tclhash.c


VI.    WHAT TO DO WITH A MODULE?

   If you have written a module and feel that you want to share
   it with the rest of the eggdrop comunity, upload it to the incoming
   directory on ftp.eggheads.org(/pub/eggdrop/incoming). Place a nice
   descriptive text with it and makes it way to the modules directory.
   Don't forgot to write for which eggdrop version this module is for...
