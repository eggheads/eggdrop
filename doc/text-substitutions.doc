###### MOTD ######

The MOTD (Message Of The Day) file is displayed every time a user opens
a dcc chat or telnet session with the bot (so it shouldn't be TOO long).

There are a few %-variables you can insert into the motd, which will
be interpreted by eggdrop:

There are four variables that can be used to format text:

 %b   display bold
 %v   display inverse
 %_   display underline
 %f   display flashing via telnet, bold underline via irc

These variables will be replaced in the MOTD by their respective values:

 %B   bot's nickname (i.e., "LamestBot")
 %V   current eggdrop version (i.e., "eggdrop v1.6.0")
 %E   long form of %V (i.e., "Eggdrop v1.6.0  (c)1997 Robey Pointer (c)1999, 2000  Eggheads")
 %C   channels the bot is on (i.e., "#lamest, #botnetcentral")
 %A   whatever is set in the config file by 'set admin'
 %n   whatever is set in the config file by 'set network'
 %T   the current time (i.e., "15:00")
 %N   the current user's nickname (i.e., "Robey")
 %U   the current operating system the bot is running on
 %%   a percent sign ("%")

You can also encode messages which can only be read by people
with certain flags:

 %{+m}
 Only masters would see this.
 %{-}
 
 %{+A}
 Only people with user flag A see this.
 %{-}
 
 %{+b}
 This is only displayed to users doing a remote '.motd' from another bot.
 %{-}

 %{+|m}
 Only channel masters would see this.
 %{-}
 
 Other variables:

 %{cols=N}     start splitting output into N columns
 %{cols=N/W}   same as above, but use a screen width of W
 %{end}        end calumniated or restricted (i.e. %{+m}) block
 %{center}     center the following text (70 columns)
