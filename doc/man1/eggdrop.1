.SH NAME
eggdrop \- an IRC bot
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B eggdrop
.RB [ options ]
.RB [ config-file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Eggdrop
is the World's most popular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) bot; it is freely
distributable under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Eggdrop
is a feature rich program designed to be easily used and expanded upon by both
novice and advanced IRC users on a variety of hardware and software platforms.
.PP
An IRC bot is a program that sits on an IRC channel and performs automated
tasks while looking just like a normal user on the channel. Some of these
functions include protecting the channel from abuse, allowing privileged
users to gain op or voice status, logging channel events, providing
information, hosting games, etc.
.PP
One of the features that makes Eggdrop stand out from other bots is module and
Tcl scripting support. With scripts and modules, you can make the bot perform
almost any task you want. They can do anything from preventing floods to greeting
users and banning advertisers from channels.
.PP
You can also link multiple Eggdrop bots together to form a botnet. This can
allow bots to op each other securely, control floods efficiently, and even
link channels across multiple IRC networks. It also allows the Eggdrops share
user lists, ban lists, exempt/invite lists, and ignore lists with other bots
if userfile sharing is enabled. This allows users to have the same access on
every bot on your botnet. It also allows the bots to distribute tasks such as
opping and banning users. See doc/BOTNET for information on setting up a botnet.
.PP
Eggdrop needs a config file to run. For an example, have a look at
.B eggdrop.conf
which is distributed with Eggdrop.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Display a list of command-line options.
.TP
.B \-n
Don't background. Normally, Eggdrop will move itself into the background when
you start it up, meaning you'll get another shell prompt, and you can do other
things while the bot is running. With \-n, you won't return to the shell prompt
until the bot exits (which won't normally happen until it's killed). By default,
\-n will send all log entries to the console.
.TP
.B \-nt
Don't background, use terminal. This is just like \-n, except that instead of
seeing log entries, your console will simulate a DCC chat with the bot.
.TP
.B \-nc
Don't background, show channel info. This is just like \-n, except that instead
of seeing log entries, every 10 seconds your screen will clear and you will see
the current channel status, sort of like "top".
.TP
.B \-m
Create userfile. If you don't have a userfile, this will make Eggdrop create
one and give owner status to the first person that introduces himself or
herself to it. You'll need to do this when you first set up your bot.
.TP
.B \-v
Show version info, then quit.
.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.B SIGCHLD
This signal is ignored by Eggdrop and can be used to determine whether it's
running or not.
.TP
.B SIGTERM
By default Eggdrop will save its user and channel file and die. A script can
override the default handler by registering with the EVNT bind and returning 1.
.TP
.B SIGHUP
By default Eggdrop will rehash (reload its config file). A script can override
the default handler by registering with the EVNT bind and returning 1. 
.TP
.B SIGQUIT
By default Eggdrop will restart. A script can override the default handler by
registering with the EVNT bind and returning 1.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.B EGG_LANG
This variable can be set to the language in which you want Eggdrop to speak
 to you. It defaults to English, but German, French, Finnish, and Danish
are supported, too.
.TP
.B EGG_LANGDIR
Specifies the directory where all your language files are stored.
The default is ./language.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
tclsh(1),
irc(1),
ircII(1),
ircd(8)
.PP
There is extensive
.B online documentation.
Once you get the bot running, open a DCC chat with it, and type:
.B .help
.PP
In addition, the files in the \fBdoc/\fR directory provide \fBdetailed
information\fR about how Eggdrop works and how to use it.
