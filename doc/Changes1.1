Eggdrop Changes (since version 1.0)

    _____________________________________________________________________

1.1.6+w1 (October 3, 1999)

  # Patch by: Wild <wild@klondike.com>

  - hrm, enforce_stick was broken, seems i regressed a patch to an older
    version of the routine, only affected stick bans when restarting a
    channel and enforced global stick bans on channels marked -global.

  - No need to check for +v status on deop, eggdrop does a who for each
    deop, not necessary since it flags +v status to a user anyway.

  - No longer use a userfile if it is 0 length, will attempt to use the
    backup also.

  - Added the "Last message repeated x times" to the logging.

  - chmod 600 logfiles,notefile,pid file.

  - Bounds checking on hostmasks for ignores/bans/users (9!10@63), you can
    easily crash an entire shared botnet.

  - whois was broke with legal full length hostmasks.

  - Fixed broken join +k channels


1.1.6 (June 17, 1999)

  # Patch by: Wild <wild@klondike.com>

  - Fix broken ban/ignore mask handling, no longer allows things like ":" in
    ban masks

  - If a DNS lookup fails (usually a two minute hang) let's not increment
    ports 3+ times (timer spin of ten minutes)

  - When bot A's address is the same as bot B's, use 'localhost', handy when
    behind a firewall, while still allowing relay/linking

  - Added +/-global to channel options, -global allows global bans not to
    affect that channel.

  - Added +/-cycle, don't bother trying to cycle the channel when opless

  - Added config option server-update, don't bother updating the serverlist

  - Added a wait time when too many nicks numeric is encountered.

  - Changed nick tracing to use ISON, will wait if above is active (5 min)

  - Fixed up using bots in terminal mode, checks/adds HQ user if necessary,
    with +n flag, and a pass (random), no hosts.

  - Fixed fr0ked -MEM_DEBUG, blowfish/assoc/fileq were sending
    /mod/somedir/myfile.c, completely fucked up debug (non-module)

  - Fixed fr0ked .un/stick #, it was copying the host back over the number,
    crashed soon as you sent anything more to the bot. (If 1 is one byte,
    how do you expect the real host to fit into that one byte?)

  - stick sharing was broken.

  - Add channel option +/-stickban for improved stickban handling


1.1.5 (June 29, 1997):

    can get certain files)
  - Move more things into NO_IRC such as bans and hostmasks
  - Move NO_IRC to irc.so

  - Added a .page command (and related Tcl page) when a user has paging on
    (.page <number>) then every number lines the bot stops sending the info
    and queues for later sending (useful in telnet where there's normally
    no way to look back)

  - Somewhere along the line someone lost a ! in cmd_boot
    Found by: Melvan

  - Greatly improved the way the bot keeps track of its nick (it doesn't
    assume it's going to get the nick anymore, it waits for the NICK from
    the server)
    Patch by: poptix

  - Added support for the 206 (RPL_TRACESERVER) and 351 (RPL_VERSION)
    numerics the VERSION numeric is used to check the bots current nick and
    the TRACESERVER numeric is what ircu2.9.30 and up respond with instead
    of TRACEFAILED (which was part of the NICK problems)

    provide it with an idx instead of port.
    Patch by: poptix

  - Added '.fixcodes' command to fix the telnet codes when they aren't right
    (say if you didn't really telnet to the bot but it thought you had it
    still sent the nasty codes)

    Patch by: Wild

  - The bot was sending mode #channel (protect modes) with almost every mode
    change, and even console changes, now keeps a current modes for each
    channel, and sends the modes when they do not match
    Patch by: Wild

  - Unsetting of read only variables from Tcl scripts is no longer possible
    hmm must I do everything the hard way the first time around? :)

    long as it is in the channel and opped)
    Suggested by: ??? / Patch by: Wild

    one is locked too (comments???)
    Patch by: Beldin

  - unvia now recursively calls itself to unvia all bots behind it
    Patch by: Beldin

  - Okay tcl_chanlist works now, and works proper.
    Examples to use it are:
      chanlist #channel n    (owner)
      chanlist #channel n&n  (owner, Channel owner)
      chanlist #channel &o   (Channel op)
      chanlist #channel omnB&omn123567890  etc. etc.
    first read flags are globals, the '&' denotes channel specific flags
    Patch by: Wild

  - +O bound dcc commands are now working proper when checking for +o flag
    either global or for a specific channel (I shoulda seen this)
    Patch by: Wild

  - check_tcl_chpt should be fixed now (was being called from botcmd.c with
    (bot,sock))
    Patch by: Wild

  - Routine to check for global_op/channel op status on channel (now also
    checks for global owner/master), for +O bound dcc commands, affects
    -/+ban, act, channel, deop, op, invite, kick, kickban, resetbans, say,
    and topic.
    [RE: This was in there...so I put the changes back in. - Wild]

    Patch by: Wild

    Patch by: Wild

  - Cleaned up tcl_chanlist
    Patch by: Wild

  TO-DO:

  - Tcl commands for:
    move/copy a file
    make/remove a dir
    get/set a dir's required flags
    get # of downloads for a file
  - files '.mv' move directories
    Suggested by: Andrej
  - '.sort' to sort files
  - Finish up botnet master implementation

  BUG REPORTS:

  - DCC sends are causing memory leaks on some systems. This affects shared
    userfile transfers
  - Some Tcl scripts handling idxes that worked before are spitting out
    invalid idx errors

  SUGGESTIONS:

  - Make MAXNOTES a Tcl variable
  - Make +s channel specific so it only shares info from that channel.
  - Make +u channel specific so it shares info from all but that channel.
  - Make +f a global-able flag
  - Channel specific file ownerships (ie, only people on a certain channel
    can get certain files)
  - Fix DEBUG_OUTPUT (in misc.c and net.c (mprintf,hprintf,tprintf) the '\n'
    needs to be trimmed off _all_ the stuff thats sent to debug1() because
    it already has a '\n' making it send an extra linefeed
  - Move more things into NO_IRC such as bans and hostmasks

  - dcc table should be used to cache user records

    Suggested by: genady

    Suggested by: By-Tor
  - +ban/-ban to be specific to your console channel: +gban/-gban for global
    bans

  - File system:
    + export directories to other bots. a notice is broadcast on the botnet
      once each hour for your exported directories (to let other bots know)
    + if 'auto-import' is on, send out an export-list-request when linking
      to a new bot. whenever other bots broadcast exported directories,
      auto-add those directories to the specified place
    + set dcc-import-path "dcc/public/"
      Snowbot exports "/gifs/party" as "pgifs" --> "dcc/public/Snowbot/pgifs"
    + quota per-directory
    + change required-flags spec from integer to chars (doh!)
    + re-implement directory headers

1.1alpha+lincoln (January 5, 1997):

  # Released by: Robey [Robey Pointer <robey@netcom.com>]

  - Notes tell you if they're going to expire soon

  - Faster memory debugging
    Suggested by: ledpighp

  - Can compile without including the file system now (for a moderate disk
    and memory savings)
    Patch by: Robey

  - Can specify a parting comment with '.quit'
    Suggested by: a person

  - 'u' flag on user specifies "unshared" (not transferred to other bots when
    sending the userfile, and kept even when downloading the userfile --
    just like bot records)
    Suggested by: exile

  - Flags o/d/f/k are channel-specific now (not global flags)

  - 'g' flag meaning "global op" (virtual +o flag for every channel), also
    used to restrict access to dcc channel commands

  - filedb's are locked from other bots when in use

  - Tcl 'valididx' to determine if an idx is ok to use
    Suggested by: By-Tor

  - Removed very old 'isolate' option

  - +r bots that try to link directly will be rebuffed without sending any
    notices to other bots
    Suggested by: genady

  - Tcl command 'backup' to backup the userfile

  - Added 'resetbans' Tcl command
    Suggested by: xerox@foonet.net

  - 'who' users same flag chars (*/+) as 'whom' now

  - 'raw' binding rewritten (WILL BREAK SCRIPTS) and no longer requires the
    +r console mode

  - Bots marked +u aren't shared either

  - Builtin bindings are now "*dcc:status" (or "*fil:ls" or "*msg:whois") to
    differentiate

  - Tcl variables that link to internal eggdrop variables are now trace
    call- backs, meaning the values change at the same time, instead of the
    Tcl variables being written and read back at each crossover between
    eggdrop and Tcl

  - 'binds' command takes an 'all' option now

  - New 'listen' Tcl command allows much better control over telnet ports:
    can mark ports as bots-only or users-only (or allow all), can specify a
    nick-mask of people allowed to use that port, can set a port to go to a
    Tcl script -- and of course, can have more than 1 port open at a time
    (limited only by the size of your dcc table)

  - Removed meaningless 'telnet-bots-only' option

  - Put "Please enter your nickname." into the banner so it can be changed

  - Help files are stored in directory tree now (that was getting too messy)

  - Besides %B type substitutions, help_subst now supports %{stuff}, like
    arbitrary flag requirements %{+m}, the end of such a block %{end}, and
    center a line of text %{center}

  - Added subst %{cols=N} cos i'm feeling wacky

  - Understands concept of sticky bans now

  - flags_ok was showing +m/+n users things that were restricted to +b
    (fixed)

  - Fixed Tcl 'chattr' to use channel flags

  - Added Tcl 'matchchanattr' to check for channel-specific flags

  - Tcl 'newban' and 'newchanban' can specify sticky bans now

  - Net module will now buffer binary connections

  - Added "turbo dcc" (set dcc-block 0) which made bot->user file transfers
    go about 2.5 times faster in rough tests (the entire file is buffered
    and then spat out thru the connection as fast as possible, ignoring the
    ack count until the entire file has been sent)

  - Revised whom info trading so that the same nick can be on more than once
    (oops) (will cause incompatibilities)

  - Instead of sending constant NICK requests, uses slightly more clever way
    to determine if its nick can be regained (which shouldn't interfere with
    user-level ISON or USERHOST requests, and will help undernet users)

  - Can set 'whois-fields' which specifies which "xtra" fields to display in
    a '.whois' listing

  - Userfile resync can cause disastrous DEsync of userfiles, so it's
    turned off by default now

  - Tried to make whom info trading be more compatible -- 1.1 bots should be
    able to decode 1.0 stuff, but 1.0 bots may lose track of away/idle info
    (can't really be helped, the 1.0 way was broken)

  - Outgoing notes marked with sock#

  - Incoming note is delivered to the first non-away session, if not marked
    with a sock# -- if all sessions are away, the oldest session is notified
    that the note arrived and was stored

  - Stackable notice binding 'notc'

  - '-bot' command is spread to sharebots
    Suggested by: genady

  - +bitch mode for channels now won't let ANYONE be an op unless the bot
    (or a master) op'd them

  - New commands 'stick' and 'unstick' to let party-line users change the
    "sticky" attribute of a ban

  - 'bans' can take an optional channel-name argument
    Suggested by: By-Tor

  - Might (?) allow ansi color codes on the party line now

  - Completely changed FILT binding (potential incompatibility)

  - Tcl 'timer' and 'utimer' can accept a 0 timer now (executed immediately
    after control returns to eggdrop)

  - Parameters set by tclhash entry points are no longer global (may solve
    some reentrancy problems)

  - When kicking +k users, a temporary channel ban is placed

  - msg 'op' command can take a specific channel as argument
    Patch by: peace

  - Writes pid file all the time now (not just when running in the
    background)
    Patch by: peace

  - DIE_ON_TERMHUP split into 2 different defines
    Patch by: peace

  - 'adduser' command will take an optional handle (in case the user
    sometimes uses a different nick)

  - Added 'uptime' read-only var
    Suggested by: vince@who.net

  - Added 'botnet-nick' for bots that wish to use a different nick on the
    botnet than on irc
    Suggested by: popular demand

  - Creation date is stuck in the "xtra" field of a new user record
    Suggested by: tyson

  - +g users can get ops even without +o on that channel (doh!)
    Patch by: ButchBub

  - Can specify a separate port in a bot's link address to use for relay
    connections (separated by a '/')
    Patch by: ButchBub

  - Tries to take advantage of ircdu's 'SILENCE' command when ignoring msgs
    & ctcps
    Suggested by: Timothy Barbeisch

  - Tcl 'bind' without a procname will return all procnames currently bound
    to that (ignoring required-flags)

  - Tcl 'putloglev' will accept any valid log level(s) now

  - compile-time option to allow stacked responses to up to 3 stacked ctcps
    Patch by: anonymous

  - Removed require-x (it's always assumed to be on)

  - 'listen' mask restriction that starts with '@' is a restriction on
    hostname not nick
