Compilation and Installation of Eggdrop
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the quick install guide, if you have had little or no experience
with unix or eggdrop, READ THE README FILE NOW! This file is only for
experienced users.

(1) WHAT IS EGGDROP?

     Please, read the file README before attempting to set up this
     bot. It is NOT easy to use! This file is a quick setup guide, not
     a miracle worker. If you enter this file without basic eggdrop
     knowledge, you will NOT leave with a working bot! Before asking
     ANY questions, READ THE README FILE OR YOU WILL BE BURNED TO A
     HORRIBLE DEATH! IF YOU DO NOT READ THAT FILE I WILL PERSONALLY
     WALK TO YOUR TERMINAL AND BEAT IT WITH A SMELLY SNEAKER! By the
     way, read README.

(2) QUICK STARTUP

     Eggdrop uses the GNU autoconfigure scripts, to make things
     easier.

  1. Type './configure' from the eggdrop directory.  That script will
     determine how your system is set up, and figure out how to compile
     eggdrop.  It will also try to find Tcl, which is required to compile.

  2. Type 'make' from the eggdrop directory.  Or to force a statically
     linked module bot type 'make static'.  Otherwise the Makefile will
     determin which type of bot your system will support.  Dynamic isalways
     the better way to go if possible. There're also the options debug and
     sdebug (static-debug) which will give more detailed output on (a
     highly unlikely :) crash. This might help the devteam to track down
     the crash and fix the bug. Debug and sdebug will take a little longer
     to compile and will enlarge the binary a bit, but it's worth if you
     want to support eggdrop development.

  3. Eggdrop must be installed in a directory somewhere.  This is
     accomplished by entering the unix command:

     make install DEST=<directory>
     example make install DEST=/home/egguser/eggdrop
     (note you must use full path for every file to be correctly installed)

     [The following is performed from the directory installed above]

  4. Copy the file 'eggdrop.conf.dist' to a new file, usually the same name
     as the bot that will use it, e.g. "LamestBot".

  5. Edit your config file LamestBot completely.

  6. Start the bot with the "-m" option to create a user file, ie 'eggdrop
     -m LamestBot'.

  7. When starting the bot in the future, drop the "-m".  If you have
     edited your bot script correctly, you can type:
     chmod u+x <my-bot-script-name>
     e.g.
     chmod u+x LamestBot

     and from then on, you will be able to run your bot directly from the
     script.  So you can just type "LamestBot" from your shell prompt to
     start up your bot.  For this to work, the top line of your script MUST
     contain the correct path to eggdrop.

  8. It's advisable to run your bot via crontab so that it will
     automatically restart if the machine goes down or (heaven forbid) the
     bot should crash. Look at the file 'scripts/botchk' and
     'scripts/autobotchk' for a great start with crontabbing the bot.

  9. Smile, and if you haven't already read the README file in its
     entirety, go take a long walk off a short pier.

(3) MODULES

  1. Modules are small pieces of code that can either be compiled into the
     binary or can be compiled seperatly in a file.  This allows for a much
     smaller binary and a way of choosing which options you want installed
     in the bot.  Before you compile the bot you can remove any *.mod
     directory in the src/mod that you dont wish to be compiled.  Use
     caution though most of the modules that come with eggdrop the are
     required.  The exception is woobie.mod and seen.mod.  If you do not
     want these modules it is safe to delete those directories.

  2. If there are any personal modules that you have made or downloaded you
     can add them to the bot by placing them in the /src/mod directory with
     a mod extension.  They will be automatically compiled during the make
     for you.  They must have a valid make file and of course be
     compatiable with the rest of the eggdrop source.

  3. If you wish to add a module at a latter time follow the same steps in
     paragraph 2.  After you have moved the appropriate files you will only
     need to type make modules to compile only the modules portion of the
     bot.

(3) FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

  1. WHAT DO I DO IF...?
     READ THE README FILE!

  2. THE README DOES NOT ANSWER...!
     READ THE README FILE AGAIN!

  3. I still don't know how to....
     Well, go to www.egghelp.org or www.eggheads.org and see if you can
     find there what you're looking for. There're also lots of IRC help
     channels (usually #eggdrop) and various mailinglists. Try Eggheads
     mailinglist http://www.eggheads.org/mailman/listinfo/eggheads

This is the end. If you read to this point, hopefully you have also read
the README file. If not, then READ IT!&@#%@!

Have fun with Eggdrop!
