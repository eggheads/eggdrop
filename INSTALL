                   Compilation and Installation of Eggdrop


  This is the quick install guide; if you have had little or no experience
  with UNIX or Eggdrop, READ THE README FILE NOW! This file is only for
  experienced users.

  For more information on compiling Eggdrop, see the Compile Guide in
  doc/COMPILE-GUIDE (and of course, the README FILE).

  Contents:
    1. What is Eggdrop?
    2. Quick startup
    3. Modules
    4. Frequently asked questions


  (1) WHAT IS EGGDROP?

    Please, read the README file before attempting to set up this bot. This
    file is a quick setup guide, not a miracle worker. If you enter this file
    without basic Eggdrop knowledge, you will NOT leave with a working bot!
    Before asking ANY questions, READ THE README FILE OR YOU WILL BE BURNED
    TO A HORRIBLE DEATH! IF YOU DO NOT READ THAT FILE I WILL PERSONALLY WALK
    TO YOUR TERMINAL AND BEAT IT WITH A SMELLY SNEAKER! By the way, read the
    README file.

  (2) QUICK STARTUP

    Eggdrop uses the GNU autoconfigure scripts to make things easier.

      1. Type './configure' from the Eggdrop directory. The configure script
         will determine how your system is set up and figure out how to
         correctly compile Eggdrop. It will also try to find Tcl, which is
         required to compile.

      2. Type either 'make config' or 'make iconfig' to determine which
         modules will be compiled. 'make config' compiles the default modules
         (everything but woobie.mod). If you want to choose which modules to
         compile, use 'make iconfig'.

      3. Type 'make' from the Eggdrop directory, or to force a statically
         linked module bot, type 'make static'. Otherwise, the Makefile will
         compile whatever type of bot the configure script determined your
         system will support. Dynamic is always the better way to go if
         possible. There are also the 'debug' and 'sdebug' (static-debug)
         options, which will give more detailed output on a (highly unlikely :)
         crash. This will help the development team track down the crash and
         fix the bug. Debug and sdebug will take a little longer to compile
         and will enlarge the binary a bit, but it's worth it if you want to
         support Eggdrop development.

      4. Eggdrop must be installed in a directory somewhere.  This is
         accomplished by entering the UNIX command:

           make install

         This will install the Eggdrop in your home directory in a directory
         called 'eggdrop' (i.e. /home/user/eggdrop).

         If you want to install to a different directory, use:

           make install DEST=<directory>

         For example:

           make install DEST=/home/user/otherdir

         Note that you must use full path for every file to be correctly
         installed.

         [The following is performed from the directory installed above.]

      5. Edit your config file completely.

      6. Start the bot with the "-m" option to create a user file, i.e. './eggdrop
         -m LamestBot.conf'.

      7. When starting the bot in the future, drop the "-m". If you have edited
         your config file correctly, you can type:

           chmod u+x <my-config-file-name>

         For example:

           chmod u+x LamestBot.conf

         From then on, you will be able to use your config file as a shell
         script. You can just type "./LamestBot.conf" from your shell prompt
         to start up your bot. For this to work, the top line of your script
         MUST contain the correct path to the Eggdrop executable.

      8. It's advisable to run your bot via crontab, so that it will
         automatically restart if the machine goes down or (heaven forbid)
         the bot should crash. Look at 'scripts/botchk' and 'scripts/autobotchk'
         for a great start with crontabbing the bot.

      9. Smile, and if you haven't already read the README file in its
         entirety, go take a long walk off a short pier.

  (3) MODULES

    Modules are small pieces of code that can either be compiled into the
    binary or can be compiled separately into a file. This allows for a much
    smaller binary.

    If there are any modules that you have made or downloaded, you can add
    them to the bot by placing them in the /src/mod directory with a mod
    extension. They will be automatically compiled during make for you.
    They must have a valid Makefile and, of course, be compatible with
    the rest of the Eggdrop source.

    If you wish to add a module at a later time, follow the same steps in
    paragraph 2. After you have moved the appropriate files, you will only
    need to type 'make modules' to compile only the modules portion of the
    bot.

  (3) FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

    (Q) What do I do if...?

    (A) READ THE README FILE!

    (Q) The readme does not answer...!

    (A) READ THE README FILE AGAIN!

    (Q) I still don't know how to...

    (A) MEMORIZE THE README FILE!

    (Q) But...

    (A) Well, go to www.egghelp.org or www.eggheads.org and see if you can
        find there what you're looking for. There are also lots of IRC help
        channels and various mailing lists, as seen in the README FILE.

  This is the end. If you read to this point, hopefully you have also read
  the README file. If not, then READ IT!&@#%@!

  Have fun with Eggdrop!
