EGGDROP -- AN IRC BOT

Eggdrop is the most advanced IRC robot available.  It has been under
development since December 1993, and, unlike most other bots, it is
still regularly updated.  Its features include:

  * completely different channel user lists like having a seperate bot for 
    each channel.

  * complete channel protection, customizable via config file: permanently
    store a ban list with comments, etc

  * user records saved on disk and alterable via dcc chat: each user can
    have a password (encrypted), a list of valid hostmasks, a set of access
    flags, etc
  
  * the ability to "learn" new users (if you choose to have the bot do so)
    by letting users /MSG the bot "hello" and granting them automatic access
    of whatever type you specify (or even no access at all)

  * a "party line" available through dcc chat or telnet, with multiple 
    channels, giving you the ability to talk to people without being affected
    by netsplits

  * console mode: you can view each channel through dcc chat or telnet,
    selectively looking at mode changes, joins and parts, channel talk, or
    any combination of the above

  * a file system where people can upload and download files, in an
    environment that looks and acts (for the most part) like a typical
    unix system -- plus the ability to mark directories as hidden/
    unaccessable to people without certain user flags

  * bot network: link two or more bots together for a party line that can
    stretch not only across channels, but across irc networks (one bot on
    EFnet, one bot on Undernet, etc)

  * script language: commands and features can be added to the bot on the
    fly, by means of the TCL script language, giving you the power of TOTAL
    customization of your bot -- similar to ircII script

!!!  WARNING  !!!

Eggdrop is NOT a simple bot to use.  It is an advanced bot for people who
know IRC and know what they're doing.  If you don't know what DCC CHAT is
or how to use it -- if you don't know the difference between #channels and
&channels -- if you don't know what a clonebot or CTCP avalanche is -- then
this bot is not for you.  Choose a simpler bot like Vladbot or Baloobot or
ComBot, or find one of the many scriptbots to use.

  This is the 1.3.x branch of the Eggdrop Bot.

*** NOTE:

    This bot is NOT intended for users of very limited MEMORY or DISK
    shell accounts.  The development of this latest design of Eggdrop
    is geared towards features and flexibility.  If you have restraints
    on the resources allowed to run your bot, then you should instead
    consider the 1.0 Eggdrop version.

***

This latest development of Eggdrop is now compilable in either of two
configurations:

MODULE - dynamic

   The MODULE version of Eggdrop 1.3.x provides for the on-the-fly
   loading of extensions to the bot code without having to recompile
   the entire bot.  This is available on OS platforms which support
   dynamically linked/shared libraries in their run-time and TCL
   libraries.  It allows for functionality of the bot to be loaded
   and unloaded at any time.

   The base loadable modules distributed with this Eggdrop version
   are:
        assoc           This is the functionality of the `assoc'
                        command for naming party `chat' lines.  It
                        also serves as an example for writing your
                        own modules.
        blowfish        The standard Eggdrop encrypting routines
                        for passwords and other encrytions.  This
                        can be replaced with a user-written module
                        to perform their own encrypting algorithms.
        channels        This allows eggdrop to have channel info stored
                        and used on that server that you allowed for with
                        the server module.
        console         This provides storage of console settings when you
                        exit the bot (or .store).
        ctcp            This provides the normal ctcp replies that you'd
                        expect.
        filesys         This module performs the file-system
                        operation for DCC file transfers to and from
                        the BOT over via IRC DCC commands.
        irc             This controls all other irc related stuff. Not
                        loading it is the equivalent of the old NO_IRC
                        setting.
        notes           This provides support for storing of notes for
                        users from each other. Notes between currently
                        online users is supported in the core, this is
                        only for storing the notes for later retrieval,
                        direct user->user notes are built-in.
        seen            This provides seen commands via msg, on channel or
                        via dcc, similar to the various scripts.
        server          This allows eggdrop to connect to a server, but
                        that's about it.
        share           This provides the userfile sharing support (this
                        requires the channels & transfer modules).
        transfer        This module performs the bot-to-bot userfile
                        sharing necessary for sharebots.  It is
                        loaded automatically when filesys is loaded.  
        wire            This provides an encrypted partyline
                        communication.
        woobie          This is a example/skeletal module for writing
                        your own module.

MODULE - static

   The STATIC-MODULE version of Eggdrop 1.3.x is pretty much the same
   as the module bot, except each individual module is linked into the
   excutable. You still need to 'loadmodule <module>' to turn them on.
  
See the file doc/MODULES for more specific MODULE information.
New to 1.3.0:

**** BOTNET

Major protocol changes, lots less messages & bytes used.

You WILL get double messages if you link OLD<->NEW<->NEW<->OLD
(or any number of NEW's between them).
To prevent this, have all your new bots on 1 side of the botnet, and
all the old ones  on the other (although OLD<->NEW<->OLD should be ok).

The order of the version and handshake messages has reversed this means
on a new botlink between an OLD & a NEW, but you must .link from the OLD
or the NEW wont know the password.

**** USERLIST

If you want to have the option of going back to an old version SAVE your
userlist!!  This is a new version userlist, and it's not backwards
compatible once written (it can still READ old userlists take note).

**** FLAGS

Flags have multiplied & split up: normal user/channel flags still exist 
and are setable by .chattr.  You can also now use .chattr +o|-o #channel.
New are the "user-defined" flags which are all of A-Z for users & channels.
Also, bot attributes are seperated now and are set using .botattr.
Bots have "user-defined" flags 0-9.
The old 0-9 user defined flags will be converted to A-J when you upgrade your
userfile.

**** SHARING

*BIG CHANGE* well, big in use, small in code ;)

There are now 2 sharing flags, +p = passive share, +s = aggressive share.
Your bot will only accept sharing with passively with 1 bot at a time, 
although any number of aggressive shares is fine.

Consider the botnet:

HubBotA
  |-+LeafBotA
  `-+HubBotB
       |-+LeafBotB
  `-or `-+LeafBotC
       
Flags would be set as such:

HubBotA has:
   LeafBotA: +sl
   HubBotB : +s
   LeafBotC: +sl
LeafBotA has:
   HubBotA : +ph
HubBotB  has:
   LeafBotB: +sl
   LeafBotC: +sl
LeafBotB has:
   HubBotB : +ph
LeafBotC has:
   HubBotB : +ph
   HubBotA : +ph
   
how's that look? :)

**** Installation

  make install DEST=<directory>
