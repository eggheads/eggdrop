EGGDROP FEATURES


  Eggdrop is the most advanced IRC robot available. It has been under
  development since December 1993, and unlike most other bots, it is
  still regularly updated. Some of its features include:

    -   Support for SSL-enabled IRC servers
    -   Support for IPv6 users
    -   Completely separate channel user lists like having a separate
        bot for each channel.
    -   A "party line" available through dcc chat or telnet, with
        multiple channels, giving you the ability to talk to people
        without being affected by netsplits.
    -   A "botnet". A botnet consists of one or more bots linked
        together. This can allow bots to op each other securely, control
        floods efficiently, and share user lists, ban lists,
        exempt/invite lists, and ignore lists (if sharing is enabled).
    -   User records are saved on disk and alterable via dcc chat. Each
        user can have a password (encrypted), a list of valid hostmasks,
        a set of access flags, etc.
    -   The ability to "learn" new users (if you choose to let the bot
        do so) by letting users /MSG the bot "hello". The bot will grant
        them automatic access of whatever type you specify (or even no
        access at all).
    -   A file system where users can upload and download files in an
        environment that looks and acts (for the most part) like a
        typical UNIX system. It also has the ability to mark files and
        directories as hidden -- unaccessible to people without certain
        user flags.
    -   Console mode: you can view each channel through dcc chat or
        telnet, selectively looking at mode changes, joins and parts,
        channel talk, or any combination of the above.
    -   A scripting language: commands and features can be easily added
        to the bot by means of the Tcl scripting language, giving you
        the power of TOTAL customization of your bot.
    -   Module support: you can remove/add features to your bot by
        adding or removing modules.

  NOTE:

    This bot is NOT intended for users of very limited MEMORY or DISK
    shell accounts. The development of this latest design of Eggdrop is
    geared towards features and flexibility.
