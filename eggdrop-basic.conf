##### BASIC SETTINGS #####

## Set the nick the bot uses on IRC, and on the botnet unless you specify a
## separate botnet-nick, here.
set nick "Lamestbot"

## Set the alternative nick which the bot uses on IRC if the nick specified
## by 'set nick' is unavailable. All '?' characters will be replaced by random
## numbers.
set altnick "Llamab?t"

## Set what should be displayed in the real-name field for the bot on IRC.
## This can not be blank, it has to contain something.
set realname "/msg LamestBot hello"

## This setting defines the username the bot uses on IRC. This setting has no
## effect if an ident daemon is running on your bot's machine. See also ident
## module.
set username "lamest"

# Specify here the filename Eggdrop will save its pid to. If no pidfile is
# specified, pid.(botnet-nick) will be used.
#set pidfile "pid.LamestBot"

## This setting defines which contact person should be shown in .status,
## /msg help, and other places. You really should include this information.
set admin "Lamer <email: lamer@lamest.lame.org>"

## This setting is used only for info to share with others on your botnet.
## Set this to the IRC network your bot is connected to.
set network "I.didn't.edit.my.config.file.net"

# Un-comment the next line and set the list of owners of the bot.
# You NEED to change this setting.
# This is a list of handles -- usernames in the bot.
#set owner "MrLame, MrsLame"

## This is the bot's server list. The bot will start at the first server listed,
## and cycle through them whenever it gets disconnected. You need to change these
## servers to YOUR network's servers.
##
## The format is:
##   server[:port[:password]]
## Prefix the port with a plus sign to attempt a SSL connection:
##   server:+port[:password]
## If you need to specify a numeric server IPv6 address, enclose it in square
## brackets.
##
## Both the port and password fields are optional; however, if you want to set a
## password or use SSL you must also set a port. If a port isn't specified it
## will default to your default-port setting.
set servers {
  you.need.to.change.this:6667
  another.example.com:7000:password
  [2001:db8:618:5c0:263::]:6669:password
  ssl.example.net:+6697
}


###########################################################################
## Network settings overview
## With the addition of IPv6 and the associated config changes, here are some
## BASIC common networking scenarios, along with the appropriate settings
## needed:
##
## SHELL PROVIDER (MULTIPLE IPs/VHOSTS)
## * set vhost4 or vhost6 to the IP/vhost you want to use
## * set listen-addr to the same IP/vhost as above
##
## HOME COMPUTER/VPS, DIRECT INTERNET CONNECTION (SINGLE IP, NO NAT)
## * do not set vhost4/vhost6
## * do not set listen-addr
##
## HOME COMPUTER, BEHIND A NAT
## * do not set vhost4/vhost6
## * do not set listen-addr
## * set nat-ip to your external IP
##
## Below is a detailed description of each setting, please read them to
## learn more about their function.
############################################################################

## If your host has multiple IPv4 addresses, uncomment and set this variable
## to the IP you wish to use for connecting to IRC.
#set vhost4 "virtual.host.com"
#set vhost4 "99.99.0.0"

# If your host has multiple IPv6 addresses, uncomment and set this variable
# to the IP you wish to use for connecting to IRC.
#set vhost6 "my.ipv6.host.com"
#set vhost6 "2001:db8::c001:b07"

## IPv4/IPv6 address (or hostname) to bind for listening. If you don't set
## this variable, eggdrop will listen on all available IPv4 or IPv6 interfaces,
## depending on the 'prefer-ipv6' variable (see below).
## Note that eggdrop will accept IPv4 connections with IPv6 sockets too.
#set listen-addr "99.99.0.0"
#set listen-addr "2001:db8:618:5c0:263::"
#set listen-addr "virtual.host.com"

## If you have a NAT firewall, enter your outside IP here. This IP
## is used for transfers and CTCP replies only, and is different than the
## vhost4/6 and listen-addr settings. You likely still need to set them.
#set nat-ip "127.0.0.1"

## If you want all dcc file transfers to use a particular portrange either
## because you're behind a firewall, or for other security reasons, set it
## here.
#set reserved-portrange 2010:2020

## Prefer IPv6 over IPv4 for connections and dns resolution?
## If the preferred protocol family is not supported, the other one
## will be tried.
set prefer-ipv6 0

## If you want to have your Eggdrop messages displayed in a language other
## than English, change this setting to match your preference. An alternative
## would be to set the environment variable EGG_LANG to that value.
##
## Languages included with Eggdrop: Danish, English, French, Finnish, German.
#addlang "english"

##### LOG FILES #####

## See eggdrop.conf for documentation on the logfile flags and settings.

# This creates a logfile named eggdrop.log that captures items logged at the
# m, c, and o log levels (private msgs/ctcps, commands/errors, and misc 
# info) from any channel.
logfile mco * "logs/eggdrop.log"

# This creates a logfile named lamest.log that captures items logged at the
# j, p, and k log levels (joins/parts/quits/netsplits, public chat,
# kicks/bans/mode changes) on the channel #lamest.
#logfile jpk #lamest "logs/lamest.log"

## This should be 0 for disk space restricted shells, and 1 if you want to
## generate channel statistics with tools such as pisg.
## If it is 0, eggdrop will delete logfiles older than 2 days.
## If it is 1, eggdrop will keep logging into the specified logfiles forever.
## See eggdrop.conf for more detailed settings.
set log-forever 0

## Code to set settings based on the above setting, do not edit this.
if {${log-forever}} {
	set switch-logfiles-at 2500
	set keep-all-logs 0
}

## "Writing user file..." and "Writing channel file..." messages won't be logged
## anymore if this option is enabled. If you set it to 2, the "Backing up user
## file..." and "Backing up channel file..." messages will also not be logged.
## In addition to this, you can disable the "Switching logfiles..." and the new
## date message at midnight, by setting this to 3.
set quiet-save 0

##### FILES AND DIRECTORIES #####

# Specify here the filename your userfile should be saved as.
set userfile "LamestBot.user"

# Specify here where Eggdrop should look for help files. Don't modify this
# setting unless you know what you're doing!
set help-path "help/"

##### BOTNET/DCC/TELNET #####

## If you want to use a different nickname on the botnet than you use on
## IRC (i.e. if you're on an un-trusted botnet), un-comment the next line
## and set it to the nick you would like to use.
#set botnet-nick "LlamaBot"

## This opens a telnet port by which you and other bots can interact with the
## Eggdrop by telneting in.
##
## There are more options for the listen command in doc/tcl-commands.doc. Note
## that if you are running more than one bot on the same machine, you will want
## to space the telnet ports at LEAST 5 apart, although 10 is even better.
##
## Valid ports are typically anything between 1025 and 65535 assuming the
## port is not already in use.
##
## If you would like the bot to listen for users and bots in separate ports,
## use the following format:
##
##   listen 3333 bots
##   listen 4444 users
##
## If you wish to use only one port, use this format:
##
##   listen 3333 all
##
## You can setup a SSL port by prepending a plus sign to it:
##
##   listen +5555 all
##
## You need to un-comment this line and change the port number in order to open
## the listen port. You should not keep this set to 3333.
#listen 3333 all

##### SSL SETTINGS #####

## Settings in this section take effect when eggdrop is compiled with TLS
## support. If you didn't generate SSL keys already, you can type 
## 'make sslcert' in your eggdrop source directory.
##
## IMPORTANT: The following two settings MUST be uncommented in order to
## use SSL functionality!
#set ssl-privatekey "eggdrop.key"

## Specify the filename where your SSL certificate is located. If you
## don't set this, eggdrop will not be able to act as a server in SSL
## connections. Must be in PEM format.
#set ssl-certificate "eggdrop.crt"

## Specify the location at which CA certificates for verification purposes
## are located. These certificates are trusted. If you don't set this,
## certificate verification will not work.
set ssl-capath "/etc/ssl/"

## Enable certificate authorization. Set to 1 to allow users and bots to
## identify automatically by their certificate fingerprints. Setting it
## to 2 to will force fingerprint logins. With a value of 2, users without
## a fingerprint set or with a certificate UID not matching their handle
## won't be allowed to login on SSL enabled telnet ports. Fingerprints
## must be set in advance with the .fprint and .chfinger commands.
## NOTE: this setting has no effect on plain-text ports.
#set ssl-cert-auth 0

## You can control SSL certificate verification using the following variables.
## All of them are flag-based. You can set them by adding together the numbers
## for all exceptions you want to enable. By default certificate verification
## is disabled and all certificates are assumed to be valid. The numbers are
## the following:
##
## Enable certificate verification - 1
## Allow self-signed certificates - 2
## Don't check peer common or alt names - 4
## Allow expired certificates - 8
## Allow certificates which are not valid yet - 16
## Allow revoked certificates - 32
## A value of 0 disables verification.

## Control certificate verification for IRC servers
#set ssl-verify-server 0

## Control certificate verification for DCC chats (only /dcc chat botnick)
#set ssl-verify-dcc 0

## Control certificate verification for linking to hubs
#set ssl-verify-bots 0

## Control certificate verification for SSL listening ports. This includes
## leaf bots connecting, users telneting in and /ctcp bot chat.
#set ssl-verify-clients 0


##### COMMON MODULES SETTINGS #####

## Below are various settings for the modules included with Eggdrop.
## PLEASE READ AND EDIT THEM CAREFULLY, even if you're an old hand at
## Eggdrop, things change.

## This path specifies the path were Eggdrop should look for its modules.
## If you run the bot from the compilation directory, you will want to set
## this to "". If you use 'make install' (like all good kiddies do ;), this
## is a fine default. Otherwise, use your head :)
set mod-path "modules/"

#### DNS MODULE ####

## In case your bot has trouble finding dns servers or you want to use
## specific ones, you can set them here. The value is a list of dns servers.
## The order doesn't matter. You can also specify a non-standard port.
## The default is to use the system specified dns servers. You don't need to
## modify this setting normally. Default kernel implementations limit this list
## to 3 servers.
#set dns-servers "8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1 185.222.222.222"

#### CHANNELS MODULE ####

## Enter here the filename where dynamic channel settings are stored.
set chanfile "LamestBot.chan"

#### SERVER MODULE ####

## What is your network?
##   If your network is not specifically listed here, please see eggdrop.conf
##   for more information on what the best selection is.
## Options are:
##   EFnet
##   IRCnet
##   Undernet
##   DALnet
##   freenode
##   QuakeNet
##   Rizon
##   Other (This is a good, sane option if your network/ircd is not listed here)
set net-type "EFnet"

# This is a Tcl script to be run immediately after connecting to a server. If
# you want to authenticate Eggdrop with NickServ, uncomment and edit the middle
# line below.
bind evnt - init-server evnt:init_server

proc evnt:init_server {type} {
  global botnick
  putquick "MODE $botnick +i-ws"
#  putserv "PRIVMSG NickServ :identify <password>"
}

## Set the default port which should be used if none is specified with
## '.jump' or in 'set servers'.
set default-port 6667

## This setting allows you to specify the maximum nick-length supported by your
## network. The default setting is 9. The maximum supported length by Eggdrop
## is 32.
#set nick-len 9

#### CTCP MODULE ####

## Set here how the ctcp module should answer ctcps.
## Options are:
##   0 = Normal behavior is used.
##   1 = The bot ignores all ctcps, except for CHAT and PING requests
##       by users with the +o flag.
##   2 = Normal behavior is used, however the bot will not answer more
##       than X ctcps in Y seconds (defined by 'set flood-ctcp').
set ctcp-mode 0

#### IRC MODULE ####

## Many takeover attempts occur due to lame users blindly /msg ident'ing to
## the bot and attempting to guess passwords. We now unbind this command by
## default to discourage them. You can enable these commands by commenting the
## following two lines.
unbind msg - ident *msg:ident
unbind msg - addhost *msg:addhost

#### NOTES MODULE ####

## Set here the filename where private notes between users are stored.
set notefile "LamestBot.notes"

##### SCRIPTS #####

## This is a good place to load scripts to use with your bot.

## This line loads script.tcl from the scripts directory inside your Eggdrop's
## directory. All scripts should be put there, although you can place them where
## you like as long as you can supply a fully qualified path to them.
##
## source scripts/script.tcl
## The 3 scripts below are default and shouldn't be removed.

source scripts/alltools.tcl
source scripts/action.fix.tcl
source scripts/dccwhois.tcl

## This script provides many useful informational functions, like setting
## users' URLs, e-mail address, ICQ numbers, etc. You can modify it to add
## extra entries.
source scripts/userinfo.tcl
loadhelp userinfo.help

## Use this script for Tcl and Eggdrop backwards compatibility.
## NOTE: This can also cause problems with some newer scripts.
#source scripts/compat.tcl

## This next line checks if eggdrop is being executed from the source directory, do not remove it
if {[file exists aclocal.m4]} { die {You are attempting to run Eggdrop from the source directory. Please finish installing Eggdrop by running "make install" and run it from the install location.} }

## A few IRC networks (EFnet and Undernet) have added some simple checks to
## prevent drones from connecting to the IRC network. While these checks are
## fairly trivial, they will prevent your Eggdrop from automatically
## connecting. In an effort to work-around these, we have developed a couple of
## TCL scripts to automate the process.

if {[info exists net-type]} {
  switch -- ${net-type} {
    "EFnet" {
      # EFnet
      source scripts/quotepong.tcl
    }
    "Undernet" {
      # Undernet
      source scripts/quotepass.tcl
    }
    "0" {
      # EFnet
      source scripts/quotepong.tcl
    }
    "2" {
      # Undernet
      source scripts/quotepass.tcl
    }
  }
}
