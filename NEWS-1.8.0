  What's new? To gain a full understanding of changes to Eggdrop1.8.0, 
  you can read the following documents:

    INSTALL
    README
    doc/TLS
    doc/IPV6
    doc/Changes1.8
    doc/tcl-commands.doc

  All of these documents combined will fill you in on the latest changes to
  Eggdrop in version 1.8.x. All files, with the exception of Changes1.8, are
  also available in html format in doc/html/.

  For support, feel free to visit us on Freenode #eggdrop.

  If you are upgrading from a pre-1.6 version of Eggdrop:

    1. Before you start the bot for the first time, BACKUP your userfile.

    2. DON'T USE YOUR OLD CONFIG FILE. MAKE A NEW ONE!

Changes made to Eggdrop 1.8.x from Eggdrop1.6.x:

  MODULES

    While most 3rd party modules that worked on Eggdrop1.6.x should still work
    with Eggdrop1.8.x, many of them contain a version check that only allows
    them to run on 1.6.x bots. We have removed the version check from some of
    the more popular modules provide them at 
    ftp://eggheads.org/pub/eggdrop/modules/1.8/

  SCRIPTS

    All 3rd party Tcl scripts that work with Eggdrop1.6.x fully work with
    Eggdrop1.8.x.

  ENCODINGS

    Eggdrop1.8 has been modified to support the utf-8 encoding with a fallback
    of iso8859-1. Other single-byte encodings are not yet supported, but
    full support for them is planned for a later version of Eggdrop1.8.

  IPV6

    Full IPv6 support for servers, telnet and script connections, dcc and
    botnet. See doc/IPV6 for more information.


  SSL

    Full SSL support has been added for all kinds of connections, including
    certificate verification and authorization, and partyline SSL. See doc/TLS.

  BOTNET

    Because 1.8 bots attempt to link with SSL if available everytime, make
    sure you generate a certificate on your hub bot with "make sslcert" after
    "make install".

  CONFIG

     eggdrop.conf changes:

     To ease the transition from Eggdrop1.6.x to Eggdrop1.8.0, we have created
     a list of config file changes needed at http://eggheads.org/eggconf180.txt. 
     Perhaps the most important changes are the removal of the my-ip and
     my-hostname settings, replaced by vhost4, vhost6 and the listen-addr
     setting. Check our new eggdrop.conf for examples.

     eggdrop-basic.conf:

     Eggdrop1.8.0 includes a simpler configuration file called
     eggdrop-basic.conf, which is recommended for users that do not need
     advanced Eggdrop features such as botnets. We still recommend reading the
     full eggdrop.conf and copying settings over that you might want to modify.


  WIRE REMOVED

    The wire module has been removed from eggdrop 1.8. You can still get it
    from ftp://eggheads.org/pub/eggdrop/modules/1.8/wire-2.1.tar.gz
    Note that with ssl support you can have encrypted botnet and partyline
    without wire.mod.


  DOCUMENTATION

    Documentation has been updated to reflect new and removed commands and
    variables. Almost all files have changed, so take a look at them.


  TCL COMMANDS

    A lot of changes have been made to Tcl commands. Please look at
    doc/tcl-commands.doc to see them.
