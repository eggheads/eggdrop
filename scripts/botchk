# botchk
#
# This is a script suitable for use in a crontab.  It checks to make sure
# your bot is running.  YOU NEED A SEPARATE CRON JOB FOR EACH BOT.  If your
# bot isn't found, it'll try to start it back up.
#
# You'll need to edit this script for your bot.
#
# To check for your bot every 10 minutes, put the following line in your
# crontab:
#    0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *   /home/mydir/mybot/botchk
# And if you don't want to get email from crontab when it checks you bot,
# put the following in your crontab:
#    0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *   /home/mydir/mybot/botchk >/dev/null 2>&1
#

# change this to the directory you run your bot from (capitalization COUNTS):
botdir="/home/mydir/mybot"

# change this to the name of your bot's config file (capitalization COUNTS):
botscript="mybot"

# change this to the botnet-nick of your bot (capitalization COUNTS):
botname="LamestBot"

# change this to the name of your bot's userfile (capitalization COUNTS):
userfile="data/LamestBot.user"

# change this to the name of your bot's pidfile (capitalization COUNTS):
pidfile="data/pid.LamestBot"

########## you probably don't need to change anything below here ##########
