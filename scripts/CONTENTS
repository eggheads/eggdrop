                        Directory Contents - scripts/

  These are the example scripts that come with eggdrop.  They're meant to be
  useful AND to introduce Tcl to those who haven't dealt with it before. Even
  people who program in Tcl may be confused by Eggdrop's implementation at
  first, because so many commands were added to interface with the bot.

  action.fix.tcl
    Gets rid of those ugly /me's people do instead of a .me.

  alltools.tcl
    Several useful procs for use in scripts.

  autobotchk
    Tcl script used to crontab your Eggdrop. Type 'scripts/autobotchk' from the
    Eggdrop's root directory for help.

  botchk
    A shell script which can be used for auto-starting the bot via 'cron'.

  cmd_resolve.tcl
    Adds a dcc command called '.resolve' which can be used to resolve hostnames
    or IP addresses via the partyline.

  compat.tcl
    Maps old Tcl functions to new ones, for lazy people who can't be bothered
    updating their scripts.

  dccwhois.tcl
    Enhances Eggdrop's built-in dcc '.whois' command to allow all
    users to '.whois' their own handle.

  getops.tcl
    A way for bots to get ops from other bots on the botnet (if they're on the
    same channel).

  klined.tcl
    Removes servers from your server list that your bot has been k-lined on, to
    prevent admins getting peeved with constant connects from your bot's host.

  notes2.tcl
    Check your notes on every shared bot of the hub.

  ques5.tcl
    Makes web pages of who's on each channel, updated periodically (requires
    alltools.tcl).

  quotepass.tcl
    Some servers on the Undernet will make you send 'PASS <numbers>' before
    you can connect if you did not return an identd response. This script will
    handle sending that for you.

  quotepong.tcl
    Some EFnet servers require the user to type /quote pong :<cookie>
    when identd is broken or disabled. This will send pong :<cookie> to
    the server when connecting.

  sentinel.tcl (by slennox)
    Flood protection script for Eggdrop with integrated BitchX CTCP simulation.
    This script is designed to provide strong protection for your bot and
    channels against large floodnets and proxy floods.

  userinfo.tcl
    Cute user info settings things.

  weed
    Weed out certain undesirables from an Eggdrop userlist. Type 'scripts/weed'
    from the Eggdrop's root directory for help.
