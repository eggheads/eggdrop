# This is a sample configuration file for your bot.  You will definitely
# want to edit this to set up your bot. Right now, it creates a bot called
# "LamestBot" which sits on the channel #lamest.
#
# More options can be found in files in doc/settings/.
#
# IMPORTANT: Remember to make install and cd to the directory it created
# (~/eggdrop by default) before you continue. Running the bot from
# eggdrop1.6.x/ will not work.
#
# PLEASE EDIT THIS FILE COMPLETELY! YOUR BOT WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY IF
# YOU DO NOT CONFIGURE IT CORRECTLY! WE CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!
#
# More options can be found in the files in doc/settings/.

# Don't edit the following 12 lines.

set help-path "help/"

##### Settings:

# Set the nick the bot uses on IRC, and on the botnet
# unless you specify a separate botnet-nick, here.

# Set the alternative nick which the bot uses on IRC if the nick specified by 'set nick' 
# is unavailable. All '?' characters will be replaced by random numbers.
set altnick "Llamab?t"

# Set here what should be displayed in the real-name field for the bot on IRC.
set realname "/msg LamestBot hello"

# This is the bot's server list. The bot will start at the first server listed, 
# and cycle through them whenever it gets disconnected. You need to change these 
# servers to YOUR network's servers.
set servers {
  you.need.to.change.this:6667
}

# This adds the channel #lamest to the bot's channel list. You should change
# this to a channel you would like the bot to join.

##### Files & Directories:

# The following two lines define where to store the bots user and
# channel files.
set userfile "LamestBot.user"
set chanfile "LamestBot.chan"

# This defines where the bot should store temp files.
set temp-path "/tmp"

# This creates a logfile named eggdrop.log containing private msgs/ctcps,
# commands, errors, and misc. info from any channel.
logfile msbxco * "logs/eggdrop.log"

# This creates a logfile of joins, parts, netsplits, kicks, bans, 
# mode changes, and public chat on the channel #lamest. 
logfile jpk #lamest "logs/lamest.log"

# Set the default console flags here.
set console "mkcobxs"

##### Uptime module:

# This module reports uptime statistics to http://uptime.eggheads.org.
# Go look and see what your uptime is! It takes about 9 hours to show up,
# so if your bot isn't listed, try again later.
# 
# Information sent to the server includes the bot's uptime, botnet-nick,
# server, version, and IP address. This information is stored in a temporary 
# logfile for debugging purposes only. The only publicly available information
# will be the bot's botnet-nick, version and uptime. If you do not wish for this
# information to be sent, comment out the following line.
loadmodule uptime

# You have to remove this line to make your bot start.
die "you didn't edit your config file! that's a NO NO"

##### SCRIPTS #####

# This is a good place to load scripts to use with your bot.

# This line loads script.tcl from the scripts directory inside your eggdrop's
# directory. All scripts should be put there, although you can place them where
# you like as long as you can supply a fully qualified path to them.
#
# source scripts/script.tcl

source scripts/alltools.tcl
source scripts/action.fix.tcl
source scripts/compat.tcl
source scripts/userinfo.tcl
loadhelp userinfo.help
