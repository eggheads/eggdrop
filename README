Please at least SKIM this document before asking questions.
In fact, READ IT if you've never successfully set up an eggdrop bot
before. PLEASE! READ IT!

(0) NOTICE

    Please read this file carefully before trying to set up this bot.
    Also, make SURE that you select your +n (owner) users wisely! They
    have 100% access to your bot and account! ONLY GIVE THIS POWER TO
    SOMEONE YOU TRUST COMPLETELY!!

(1) WHAT IS EGGDROP?

    Eggdrop is an IRC bot, written in C.  If you don't know what IRC is,
    this is probably not whatever you're looking for!  Eggdrop, being a
    bot, sits on a channel and takes protective measures: to keep the
    channel from being taken over (in the few ways that anything CAN),
    to recognize banished users or sites and reject them, to recognize
    priveledged users and let them gain ops, etc.

    One of the more unique features of eggdrop is its "party line",
    accessible via DCC chat, which allows you to talk to other people
    lag-free.  Consider it a multi-way DCC chat, or a miniature IRC
    (complete with channels).  You can link up with other bots and
    expand the party line until it actually becomes something very much
    like IRC, in fact.  

    Eggdrop is always being improved and adjusted because there are bugs
    to be fixed and features to be added (if the users demand them, and
    they make actually sense).  In fact, it existed for several years
    as v0.7 - v0.9 before finally going 1.0.  This version of eggdrop is
    part of the 1.3 tree.  A valiant effort has been made to chase down
    and destroy bugs.  It is definitely nowhere near as buggy as the ircII
    client.  Crashes should be rare and surprising (but aren't they always?
    [surprising anyway]).

    This README file contains information about how to get eggdrop, how to
    quickly compile the bot, what you may need to do when upgrading from 
    older versions, a list of frequently asked questions about compiling,
    how to set up a crontab, some boring legal stuff, info about the mailing
    list (a great place to ask questions, and a good place to report bugs to),
    some basics about CVS usage and some channels where you might get help
    with eggdrop.

    The preliminary documentation is in "eggdrop.doc" and is intended to be
    read after you have eggdrop compiled and set up.


(2) HOW TO GET EGGDROP

    Before you can compile eggdrop, you need to have Tcl installed on
    your system.  Most systems should have Tcl on them by now -- you
    can check by trying the command "tclsh".  If it works, you will be
    given a "%" prompt, and you can type "exit" to exit the program.
    That means Tcl is on your system.  If tclsh doesn't load, then Tcl
    probably isn't on your system, and you will need to ftp it.  The
    best ftp site is:
       ftp://ftp.scriptics.com/pub/tcl

    The best version to use right now is 8.0.4 (as recommended by
    dw@Undernet), versions like 7.6p2 are still fine to use though.

    Tcl comes with the Slackware distribution of Linux.  HOWEVER, the
    one that comes on Slackware 3.0 is goofed up and you'll have to
    re-install it for yourself to get it working.

    Currently, the 1.3 tree of eggdrop is developed at eggheads.org. You can
    get the latest version of eggdrop from ftp.eggheads.org.
    Current mirrors are:
      ftp.de.eggheads.org
      ftp.fr.eggheads.org

    You might try www.eggheads.org for help and information.

(2a) CVS USAGE

    You might obtain the *very latest* version of eggdrop that is still
    under development by using CVS. CVS means 'Concurrent Versions System'
    and is a tool for developers to always keep source code up to date.
    Try 'man cvs' on your shell for more information about CVS ;-)

    This intended only for users that know a fairly bit about eggdrop.
    Be aware that the versions of eggdrop that you get by CVS are still
    being developed, and may be buggy. The 1.3 devel team will in *NO WAY*
    take any responsability for whatever might happen to you or your shell
    if you use a CVS version of eggdrop.

    To obtain eggdrop over CVS, do as follows:

    (1) log into your shell
    (2) type 'export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.eggheads.org:/usr/local/cvsroot'
    (3) hit enter when it asks for a password.
    (4) in your home dir, type 'cvs checkout eggdrop1.3'
    (5) in ~/eggdrop1.3, you should have a copy of the latest CVS version of eggdrop.

    notes:

    (1) you can 'cvs logout', but you don't need to
    (2) you dont need to go through this whole process every time; if you want to get
        a CVS version of eggdrop at a later time, you just 'cd ~/eggdrop1.3' and type
        'cvs update'
    (3) if you errors when using 'export', you might be using tclsh as a shell; just
        'setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anonymous@cvs.eggheads.org:/usr/local/cvsroot' instead
        of using 'export'.


(3) QUICK STARTUP

    #### NOW INCLUDED IN 'INSTALL' - READ IT *AFTER* FINISHING THIS ####


(4) UPGRADING

(4a) FROM A PRE-1.3 VERSION TO 1.3
 
   #### BACK UP YOUR USERFILE ####
    
    We can't re-iterate this enough, if you are upgrading, and you have
    even a slight possibility of downgrading again later you will HAVE
    to back up your userfile, or you will lose it. 1.3 radically changes a 
    lot of things.

    There are many major changes between v0.9, v1.0, v1.1 and v1.3 so
                           PAY ATTENTION
    to this part if you have a v0.9, 1.0 or 1.1 bot already.  If you're 
    just starting out, you can skip this section.

    to 1.3:
    *  If you run sharebots, you will need to upgrade them all at the
       same time because of the new userfile format.  Older bots will
       be able to link in, but will not get or send a userfile. 1.2's
       will also tend to refuse to share with another pre1.2.
       MAKE A NEW CONFIG FILE from the example, there are some radical
       extras.

    from 0.9/1.0 to 1.3:
           * Just redo the whole thing, absolutely everything has changed
	     including the userfile and config file formats.
    from 1.1/1.2 to 1.3:
           * You will likely want to redo the config file, as much as
             changed. BACK UP!! You will need to run 
	     'tclsh scripts/weed <userfile> c' to convert your userfile
	     from v3 (1.1/1.2) to v4

(4b) FROM AN OLDER 1.3 VERSION TO A NEWER ONE

    If you followed the INSTALL file and did a 'make install' (or 'make
    install DEST=<path>') after 'make', this will be pretty easy.
    Just upload the new eggdrop1.3.xx.tar.gz file to the home dir of your
    shell, gunzip and untar it, and type 'cd ~/eggdrop1.3.xx'. Then,
    type './configure', 'make', then kill the bot ('.die' on the partyline,
    or use 'kill' on the shell) and 'make install' to the same directory
    your bot is currently in. Then, you can just restart your bot.


(5) FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (or "Why doesn't this thing work?")

    1. WHAT DO I DO IF I GET THE ERROR "USER FILE NOT FOUND"?

       (1) Run eggdrop with the "-m" option (ie, "eggdrop -m mybot").
       (2) Go to IRC and send "hello" to your bot (ie, "/msg mybot hello").
       (3) You will become an owner on your bot.  You can leave the bot
           running (nobody else will become a master if they say "hello"),
           but in the future, don't use the "-m" option when running the bot.

    2. MY EGGDROP WON'T RUN; IT JUST SAYS "CAN'T FIND YOUR HOSTNAME!"

       Your machine is set up strangely, and eggdrop can't figure out its 
       network hostname.  You can get around this by setting an environment
       variable called HOSTNAME.  In sh or ksh:
         $ HOSTNAME=myhost.domain.edu
         $ export HOSTNAME
       In csh or tcsh:
         % setenv HOSTNAME myhost.domain.edu
       It should work after that.  You may want to bug your system admini-
       strator to set up her /etc/hosts file correctly, or add those above
       commands to your '.login' file (sh or ksh: '.profile').

    3. WHAT THE HECK IS TCL?

       Tcl is a scripting language written by John Ousterhout.  It's much 
       better than most "in-built" script langauges (like the one in ircII)
       and is meant to be linked with anything needing a script language.
       So I linked it with eggdrop.

       The file "tcl-commands.doc" in the eggdrop directory contains a list
       of the commands added to Tcl by eggdrop.  There are also several
       example scripts in the scripts/ directory, and there are gobs of
       scripts floating around on the ftp sites if you like working by
       example (which is typically the best way).

    4. MY BOT DIES AND THE LAST ENTRY IN THE LOGFILE IS "RECEIVED TERMINATE
       SIGNAL".  WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND CAN I PREVENT IT?

       There's nothing you can do to prevent it.  It means the system admini-
       stator is killing the eggdrop process.  Most of the time, it's an
       automatic thing that happens when the system is being rebooted -- so
       it's harmless, and if you have a crontab running, the bot will get
       restarted when the system is back online.  Occassionally the system
       administrator will kill the bot manually -- for example, if he/she
       doesn't want bots running on the system.

    5. MY COMPILE DIES AT THE LAST MINUTE WITH "LD FATAL SIGNAL 11"!

       This happens on Linux machines which have recently been converted
       to ELF by upgrading to Slackware 3.0.  Apparently Slackware 3.0
       comes with a non-ELF (a.out) Tcl library, and the compiler doesn't
       handle that well.  (It should give you an error; instead it barfs.)
       Fixing it is tricky because even if you recompile libtcl.a, the
       linker will most likely find the "bad" one first, and your work
       will be in vain.

       Here's a fix that's been floating around on the eggdrop list:
       1. Recompile 'libtcl.a' for yourself, to make sure an ELF library
          is created.
       2. Copy it into your eggdrop/src directory, naming it 'libtcl2.a'.
       3. Edit the Makefile and change the line that says '-L/usr/lib -ltcl'
          to '-L. -ltcl2'.
       4. Recompile eggdrop.

       Also send hate-mail to the Slackware guy telling him to stop messing
       up the libraries.  He seemed to assume that everyone would still
       want to compile old-style (a.out) binaries.

    6. SOMEONE ELSE SET UP A BOT I DON'T LIKE.  ARE THERE ANY BACKDOORS I
       CAN USE TO TAKE THEIR BOT DOWN?

       No, there have never been any backdoors and there never will be,
       so please stop asking.  Every once in a while, someone finds a way
       to exploit a bug in eggdrop, but we fix these bugs as soon as I find
       out about them.  If you want to bring down someone else's bot, you
       will not have my/our help.

    6. WHAT ARE MODULES?
     
       Modules are a way of adding extra C code from the bot, much
       like tcl scripts, without requiring the bot recompiling, see
       doc/MODULES for more info.

    7. CAN I COMPILE EGGDROP WITHOUT DYNAMIC MODULES?
    
       Yes, you can, if ./configure detects that your system CAN'T run
       modules it will setup 'make' to link the modules in statically
       for you, you can also choose this option if you can do dynamic
       modules by typing 'make static'. You can also try to compile
       dynamic modules on a  static-only system by typing 'make eggdrop'.
       
       7.1 DO I STILL NEED TO 'loadmodule modules' ???
       
       YES, when you compile statically, all the modules are linked into
       the main executable *but* they are not enabled until you use
       loadmodule to enable then, hence you get nearly the same 
       functionality with static modules as dynamic modules.
       
    8. WHERE CAN I GET A PRECOMPILED EGGDROP FOR MY COMPUTER?

       It is HIGHLY recommended AGAINST using precompiled Eggdrops
       from untrusted sources.  Eggdrop has been a regular target
       for hacking and crashing.  Distribution of precompiled (binary)
       versions of Eggdrop are the easiest way of hackers to provide
       you with the easiest (and most dangerous) way of gaining access
       to not only your bot, but to your computer account directly.
       Don't advertise your precompiled eggdrop binary sites on the
       eggdrop list either =P

    9. I GET 'Makefile:3 :invalid operator' OR SOME-SUCH-THING
        WHEN I TRY TO 'make'
	
       Try 'gmake'
       
    10. WHEN I 'tclsh scripts/weed <userfile> c' IT BARFS CHUNKS AT ME
        AND DIES :(
	
	UPGRADE YOUR TCL, you are probably using tcl 7.5 or earlier,
	some of the commands in weed require tcl7.6 to run, so either
	upgrade it, or removing the offending lines from you
	userfile (those strating with '.' generally) and accept the
	loss of that data.
	
    11. I get "ld-elf.so.1: Shared object "libtcl80.so.1" not found" or
        "eggdrop: error in loading shared libraries /
         libtcl8.1.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
        when I try to start my bot.

        './configure' is looking in the wrong place for tcl; it looks like
        it compiled with one version of tcl and tries to load another.
        Maybe your sysadmin upgraded tcl and didnt tell you.
        In that case, you should just need to recompile your bot.

        Or maybe when upgrading he didnt clean the old version of tcl, and
        './configure' is looking for the files in the wrong places, or
        trying to use different versions of tcl.h and libtcl*.
        Smack your admin and have him install tcl properly ;)
        Or try to:

        ./configure --with-tcllib=<path-to-tcllib> --with-tclinc=<path-to-tclinc>

        tell configure where to look for the tcl files.
        try to look for them like:
        for libtcl: ls /usr/lib/libtcl*
                    ls /usr/local/lib/libtcl*
        for tcl.h:  ls /usr/include/tcl.h
                    ls /usr/local/include/tcl.h

        If everything else fails, try to install tcl to your home dir ;)
                                                (suggested by dw@Undernet, dw@lixom.nu)


    12. I get a whole pile of "Unresolved symbol 'Tcl_AppendResult'"
        (or some other symbol) when I try to load a modules.

        POSSIBILITY A: see 11.

        POSSIBILITY B:
	
	Some of the standard libraries have been compiled for static
	linking only on your machine, you have 3 options:
	(1) if it's your own machine, recompile TCL using dynamic linking
	    by using './configure --enable-shared' when you configure
	    TCL (not the bot) and then remake, & reinstall
	(2) if it's not you machine, you make have to resort to 
	    'make static' and 'make sinstall DESTDIR=<dir>' to make
	    and install your bot.
	(3) if you are of a more aggressive sense of mind, go beat the
            stuffing out of your admin for have lame static libraries :)
	    
(6) SETTING UP A CRONTAB

    Eggdrop has become more stable with time, thanks mostly to people detail-
    ing bugs to me and helping me find places where it crashes.  However, I'm
    sure there are still a few places where things aren't perfect -- that's
    how life works.  Also, most systems go down from time to time.  These 
    things cause your bot to disappear from IRC, and you have to restart it.

    I have included a csh script called 'botchk' which will help keep the bot
    online.  It will make the machine check every ten minutes to make sure
    your bot is still running.  To use it, you have to add a line to your
    crontab.  First, edit 'botchk' and change the directory and command line
    parameters so that it will be able to start up your bot.  Then, add this
    line to your crontab:

    0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *   /home/mydir/botchk

    If you don't want to get emails from cron, put this:

    0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *   /home/mydir/botchk >/dev/null 2>&1

    Naturally, you need to change the path to the correct path for botchk.  If
    you've never used crontab before, here is a simple way to add that line:
    Create a new file called 'mycron' and put the above line into it.  Then,
    from your shell prompt, type
      % crontab mycron
    That will create a new crontab entry for you, with a line that runs botchk
    every ten minutes.  Botchk will then restart the bot when necessary (and
    send you email informing you).


(7) BORING LEGAL STUFF

    "net.c" is by me and I also choose to place it in the public domain.
    "blowfish.c" is by various sources and is in the public domain.  All 3
    files contain useful functions that could easily be ported to other
    applications -- the other parts of the bot generally don't.

    Tcl is by John Ousterhout and is in no way affiliated with eggdrop,
    and has its own set of copyrights and whatnots, I'm sure.

    There is no warranty, implied or whatever.  You use this software at
    your own risk, no matter what purpose you put it to.

    You didn't pay for it, so don't expect magic.


(8) MAILING LIST

    There are currently a couple of mailing lists about eggdrop.
    eggheads@eggdheads.org is the one relevant for posts about
    eggdrop 1.3 (and bug fixes, and suggestions, etc).

    To subscribe to the eggheads mailing list, send email to:
      eggheads-request@eggheads.org
    In the body of the message, put "subscribe eggheads"; or go to
      http://scrambled.eggheads.org/mailman/listinfo/eggheads   

    ### DO NOT SEND ROBEY EMAIL ABOUT EGGDROP ###
    Robey is no longer developing the eggdrop code (although he does put
    a word in every now and then) so don't bother emailing him. If you
    have a serious problem, email the eggdrop mailing list and it will
    get to the coders.

    Please, before posting to this list, see what things are like, and
    when you do post, read over your post for readability, spelling, and
    grammar mistakes. Obviously, we're all human (or are we?) and we all
    make mistakes (heck, look at this document! ;). Don't flame, and
    read/follow the rules.

    This list is not, and never will be a list dedicated to those all too
    common questions we have all seen on other lists... for example:

    "Why does my bot say this: Please edit your config file."
    "How do I telnet my bot?"
    "Where do I get eggdrop for windows????????"
    etc..

    Bug reports, technical questions, your thoughts or suggestions on new
    features being added to Eggdrop, things that should be removed or fixed,
    amazing problems that even stump the guru's, etc... are what we want to
    see here.


(9) DOCUMENTATION

    We're trying to keep the documentation up to date. If you feel that anything
    is missing here, or that anything should be added etc, please email
    eggheads@eggheads.org about it, thank you.


(10) OBTAINING HELP
    
    There is currently no uniform channel in existance to support eggdrop.
    At one time, such channels did exist, but they most often esculate into
    a vanity channel, where no one is willing to help.

    However, we'll list a few places here where you *might* get help. Note
    though that we are not responsible for those channels, or neccessarily
    run those channels ourselves.
